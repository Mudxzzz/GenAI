FOREWORD
- Dr. C. GOPALAN
Founder President
Nutrition Foundation of India

It is now more than a decade since this valuable publication was first prepared.
It was compiled by a team of experienced nutrition scientists at the National
Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad, under the leadership of Dr. Kamala
Krishnaswamy. It has received wide appreciation from the general public as well as
from students of nutrition, medicine, home science, nursing and allied subjects, and
has been reprinted several times. It has also been widely disseminated through
outreach activities undertaken by the National Institute of Nutrition, in the form of
lectures, exhibitions and distribution of materials in various local languages.
In the intervening years, there have been notable socio-economic changes in
India. It was thought necessary to update the guidelines in the light of new
developments and fresh information.
The most notable change has been in the overall economic scenario in the
country, with a robust growth rate. There have also been some important
government initiatives in the fields of health and nutrition and poverty alleviation,
including the launching of MGNREGA and overhauling of the ICDS. Globalisation
has resulted in the opening of multinational fast food chains in Indian cities,
including the smaller cities. Lifestyles and dietary patterns that had started giving
early warning signals towards the end of the previous century, when these
guidelines were first published, are continuing to follow a trend that promotes
obesity and the attendant non communicable diseases.
The improvement in the overall economy at the macro level and concomitant
improvements in purchasing power (though unevenly distributed) among
households have not led to the expected levels of improvement in the nutritional
status of Indians. The latest findings of the National Family Health Survey, NFHS-3
showed virtually no improvement in parameters as compared to NFHS-2, and
recent surveys by the National Nutrition Monitoring Bureau have thrown more
light on the growing problem of the 'double burden' of undernutrition and
overnutrition. These data should serve as a wake-up call to nutritionists and policy
makers. There is very obviously an 'awareness and information deficit', even
among the more affluent sections of the population, about good dietary practices
and their linkage with good health. This deficit should be narrowed and eliminated
by harnessing all traditional as well as modern technological vehicles of
communication.
This updated version of DGI from India's premier nutrition institute, National
Institute of Nutrition, should serve as a valuable source of concise, accurate and
accessible information, both for members of the general public and those who are
involved in dissemination of nutrition and health education.

PREFACE
The first edition of 'Dietary Guidelines' was published in 1998, and since then
many changes have taken place in the country. The economic transition has
transformed the way people live. Changing lifestyles of people both in rural and
urban areas are seen to alter the very structure of our society at a rapid pace today.
The shift from traditional to 'modern' foods, changing cooking practices, increased
intake of processed and ready-to-eat foods, intensive marketing of junk foods and
'health' beverages have affected people's perception of foods as well as their dietary
behaviour. Irrational preference for energy-dense foods and those with high sugar
and salt content pose a serious health risk to the people, especially children. The
increasing number of overweight and obese people in the community and the
resulting burden of chronic non-communicable diseases necessitate systematic
nutrition educational interventions on a massive scale. There is a need for adoption
of healthy dietary guidelines along with strong emphasis on regular physical
exercise.
Today, the multiple sources of health and nutrition related information tend to
create unnecessary confusion among people. This book makes an attempt to inform
us on matters of everyday nutrition in a user friendly manner and thus, aims to
influence our dietary behavior. These guidelines deal with nutritional requirements
of people during all stages of their life, right from infancy to old age.
We earnestly hope that readers will enjoy reading the book and benefit from it
and also spread the valuable information among those around them.

INTRODUCTION
Nutrition is a basic human need and a prerequisite to a healthy life. A proper
diet is essential from the very early stages of life for proper growth, development
and to remain active. Food consumption, which largely depends on production and
distribution, determines the health and nutritional status of the population. The
recommended dietary allowances (RDA) are nutrient-centred and technical in
nature. Apart from supplying nutrients, foods provide a host of other components
(non-nutrient phytochemicals) which have a positive impact on health. Since
people consume food, it is essential to advocate nutrition in terms of foods, rather
than nutrients. Emphasis has, therefore, been shifted from a nutrient orientation to
the food-based approach for attaining optimal nutritional status. Dietary guidelines
are a translation of scientific knowledge on nutrients into specific dietary advice.
They represent the recommended dietary allowances of nutrients in terms of diets
that should be consumed by the population. The guidelines promote the concept of
nutritionally adequate diets and healthy lifestyles from the time of conception to old
age.
Formulation of dietary goals and specific guidelines would help in providing
required guidance to people in ensuring nutritional adequacy. The dietary
guidelines could be directly applied for general population or specific physiological
or high risk groups to derive health benefits. They may also be used by medical and
health personnel, nutritionists and dietitians. The guidelines are consistent with the
goals set in national policies on Agriculture, Health and Nutrition.
The dietary guidelines ought to be practical, dynamic and flexible, based on the
prevailing situation. Their utility is influenced by the extent to which they reflect the
social, economic, agricultural and other environmental conditions. The guidelines
can be considered as an integral component of the country's comprehensive plan to
reach the goals specified in the National Nutrition Policy.
The major food issues of concern are insufficient/ imbalanced intake of
foods/nutrients. The common nutritional problems of public health importance in
India are low birth weight, protein energy malnutrition in children, chronic energy
deficiency in adults, micronutrient malnutrition and diet-related noncommunicable diseases. However, diseases at the either end of the spectrum of

malnutrition (undernutrition and overnutrition) are important. Recent evidences
indicate that undernutrition in utero may set the pace for diet-related chronic
diseases in later life. Population explosion, demographic changes, rapid
urbanization and alterations in traditional habits contribute to the development of
certain unhealthy dietary practices and physical inactivity, resulting in diet-related
chronic diseases.
The dietary guidelines emphasize promotion of health and prevention of
disease, of all age groups with special focus on vulnerable segments of the
population such as infants, children and adolescents, pregnant and lactating
women and the elderly. Other related factors, which need consideration are
physical activity, health care, safe water supply and socio-economic development,
all of which strongly influence nutrition and health.
In this document, food-related approaches, both in qualitative and quantitative
terms, have been incorporated. Emphasis is on positive recommendations which
can maximize protective effects through use of a variety of foods in tune with
traditional habits. The higher goals set with respect to certain food items such as
pulses, milk and vegetables/fruits are intended to encourage appropriate policy
decisions. Suitable messages for each of these guidelines have been highlighted.
A variety of foods, which are available and are within the reach of the common
man, can be selected to formulate nutritionally adequate diets. While there are only
four accepted basic food groups, in India, there are a variety of food preparations
and culinary practices. Different cereals/millets are used as staple food, apart from
a variety of cereal/millet/pulse combinations in different regions of India. The
cooking oils and fat used are of several kinds. The proposed guidelines help to
formulate health promoting recipes and diets which are region- and culturespecific. It is difficult to compute standard portion sizes, common to all regions of
India. Nevertheless, attempts are made to give portion sizes and exchanges.
Translation of knowledge into action calls for the coordinated efforts of several
government and non-government organizations. The fifteen guidelines prescribed,
herein, stress on adequacy of intake of foods from all food groups for maintenance
of optimal health. Effective IEC strategies and other large-scale educational
campaigns should be launched to encourage people to follow the dietary
guidelines. Such efforts should be integrated with the existing national nutrition
and health programs.

CURRENT DIET AND NUTRITION SCENARIO
Health and nutrition are the most important contributory factors for human
resource development in the country. India has been classified by the World Bank
as a country with a lower middle income, with per capita GNP of US $ 996-39451. It
ranks 160th in terms of human development among 209 countries. Among the Indian
population, about 28% in the rural and 26% in the urban areas are estimated to be
below the poverty line2, which is defined as the expenditure needed to obtain, on an
average, 2400 Kcal per capita per day in the rural areas and 2100 Kcal in urban
areas. Long-term malnutrition leads to stunting and wasting, non-communicable
chronic diet related disorders, increased morbidity and mortality and reduced
physical work output. It is a great economic loss to the country and undermines
development.
Common Nutrition Problems
Protein Energy Malnutrition (PEM), micronutrient deficiencies such as vitamin A
deficiency (VAD) , Iron Deficiency Anemia (IDA), Iodine Deficiency Disorders(IDD)
and vitamin B-complex deficiencies are the nutrition problems frequently
encountered, particularly among the rural poor and urban slum communities.
Undernutrition starts as early as during conception. Because of extensive
maternal undernutrition (underweight, poor weight gain during pregnancy,
nutritional anaemia and vitamin deficiencies), about 22% of the infants are born with
low birth-weight (<2500 g)3, as compared to less than 10% in the developed
countries. Both clinical and sub-clinical undernutrition are widely prevalent even
during early childhood and adolescence. Though the prevalence of florid forms of
severe PEM like kwashiorkor and marasmus among preschool children is <1 %,
national surveys indicate that about half of (48%) <5 year children suffer from subclinical undernutrition such as underweight (43%) stunting and wasting (20%) which
indicates that undernutrition is of long duration3. The studies have shown that there
is a steep increase in the prevalence of underweight with increase of age, from 27%
at 6 months of age to a high of 45% at 24 months of age4. This is attributable to faulty
infant and young child feeding practices prevailing in the community.
Persistent undernutrition throughout the growing phase of childhood leads to
short stature in adults. About 33% of adult men and 36% of the women have a Body
Mass Index (BMI) [Weight in kg/(Height in meter)2] below 18.5, which indicates
Chronic Energy Deficiency or CED (Table1)4. In the case of vitamin A deficiency, 0.81% of preschool children show the signs of Bitot's spots and night blindness.
Vitamin A deficiency also increases the risk of disease and death.

Among children between the ages of 6 and 59 months, a majority (70%)3 are
anemic. Nearly three fourth (75%) of women in India are anemic, with the prevalence
of moderate to severe anemia being highest (50%) among pregnant women5. It is
estimated that nutritional anemia contributes to about 24%6 of maternal deaths
every year and is one of the important causes of low birth weight. It adversely affects
work output among adults and learning ability in children.
Iodine deficiency disorders (IDD) are very common among large sections of
population in several parts of the country. About 167 million are estimated to be
living in IDD endemic areas. Iodine deficiency causes goiter (enlargement of thyroid
gland in the neck), neonatal hypothyroidism, cretinism among new borns, mental
retardation, delayed motor development, stunting, deaf-mutism and neuromuscular
disorders. The most important consequence of iodine deficiency in mothers is
cretinism in which the children suffer from mental and growth retardation right from
the birth. About 90,000 still-births and neonatal deaths occur every year due to
maternal iodine deficiency. Around 54 million persons are estimated to have goiter,
2.2 million have cretinism and 6.6 million suffer from mild psycho-motor handicaps7.
India is passing through the phase of economic transition and while the problem
of undernutrition continues to be a major problem, prevalence of overnutrition is
emerging as a significant problem, especially in the urban areas. The prevalence of
overweight/ obesity is higher among the women (10.9%) compared to men (7.8%) in
rural areas4. The prevalence of Diabetes Mellitus8 and Coronary Heart Disease
(CHD)9 is also higher in urban areas as compared to their rural counterparts. The
incidence rate of cancer is comparatively higher among women (123) compared to
men (113 for 100,000)10.
Food availability and consumption
The overall production of food grains (cereals/millets/pulses) recorded a
significant increase from about 108 million tones in 1970-71 to a little over 230 million
tones during 2007-200811,12. Though the production of cereals and millets appears to
be adequate, production of pulses, the source of protein for the rural poor, actually
shows a decline. Total Production of vegetables is about 30% less than the demand
of 100 million tones13. The total production of milk during 2006-2007 was about 100.9
million tones, corresponding to about 245 g per caput per day, which is lower than
the world average of 285 g per day14. Though the per capita availability of various
foods stuffs is comparable to RDA, the distribution of foods, both within the
community and the family, may be unfavorable to some vulnerable groups due to low
income and purchasing power. In view of the high cost of milk, a large proportion of
the Indian population subsists on diets consisting mostly of plant foods with low
nutrient bio-availability (Table 2).

National Nutrition Monitoring Bureau (NNMB) surveys4 indicate that the daily
intake of all foods except cereals and millets (396g) in Indian households is lower
than the Recommended Dietary Allowances or RDA (Table 3). The average
consumption of pulses and legumes like green gram, bengal gram and black gram,
which are important source of protein was less than 50% of RDA. Consumption of
green leafy vegetables (<14g) and other vegetables (43 g), which are rich sources of
micronutrients like beta-carotene, folate, calcium, riboflavin and iron was grossly
inadequate. Intake of visible fat was also less than 50% of the RDA.

The proportion of households with energy inadequacy was about 70%, while that
with protein inadequacy was about 27%. Thus, in the cereal/millet-based Indian
dietaries, the primary bottleneck is energy inadequacy and not the protein, as was
earlier believed. This dietary energy gap can be easily reduced by the poor by
increasing the quantities of habitually eaten foods.
6

On the other side of the spectrum of malnutrition, diet-related non-communicable diseases are commonly seen. With increasing urbanization, energy-rich diets
containing higher amount of fat and sugar, which also provide less dietary fibre and
complex carbohydrates, are being frequently consumed, particularly by highincome groups. In addition, the urban population is turning to be more sedentary
with little physical activity. Consumption of alcohol, providing empty calories, and
tobacco use is also common among them. Hence, prevalence of disorders like
obesity, heart disease, hypertension (high blood pressure) diabetes and certain
types of cancers is on the increase.
Determinants of Malnutrition
Widespread malnutrition is largely a result of dietary inadequacy and
unhealthy lifestyles. Other contributing factors are poor purchasing power, faulty
feeding habits, large family size, frequent infections, poor health care, inadequate
sanitation and low agricultural production. Population living in the backward and
drought-prone rural areas and urban slums, and those belonging to the socially
backward groups like scheduled castes and tribal communities are highly
susceptible to undernutrition. Similarly, landless labourers and destitutes are also at
a higher risk.
The most rational, sustainable and long-term solution to the problem of
malnutrition is ensuring availability, accessability and consumption of adequate
amounts of foods. Dietary guidelines help to achieve the objective of providing
optimal nutrition to the population.

Guideline 1
Eat variety of foods to ensure a balanced diet
Rationale: Nutritionally adequate diet should be consumed through a
wise choice from a variety of foods
v
Nutrition is a basic prerequisite to sustain life.
v
Variety in food is not only the spice of life but also the essence of nutrition and

health.
v
A diet consisting of foods from several food groups provides all the required

nutrients in proper amounts.
v
Cereals, millets and pulses are major sources of most nutrients.
v
Milk which provides good quality proteins and calcium must be an essential

item of the diet, particularly for infants, children and women.
Oils and nuts are calorie-rich foods, and are useful for increasing the energy
v
density and quality of food.
v
Inclusion of eggs, flesh foods and fish enhances the quality of diet. However,

vegetarians can derive almost all the nutrients from diets consisting of cereals,
pulses, vegetables, fruits and milk-based diets.
v
Vegetables and fruits provide protective substances such as vitamins/

minerals/ phytonutrients.
v
Diversified diets with a judicious choice from a variety food groups provide the

necessary nutrients.
Why do we need nutritionally adequate food?
Nutrients that we obtain through food have vital effects on physical growth and
development, maintenance of normal body function, physical activity and health.
Nutritious food is, thus needed to sustain life and activity. Our diet must provide all
essential nutrients in the required amounts. Requirements of essential nutrients
vary with age, gender, physiological status and physical activity. Dietary intakes
lower or higher than the body requirements can lead to undernutrition (deficiency
diseases) or overnutrition (diseases of affluence) respectively. Eating too little food
during certain significant periods of life such as infancy, childhood, adolescence,
pregnancy and lactation and eating too much at any age can lead to harmful
consequences. An adequate diet, providing all nutrients, is needed throughout our
lives. The nutrients must be obtained through a judicious choice and combination of
a variety of foodstuffs from different food groups (Figure 1).

EAT SPARINGLY

EAT MODERATELY

EAT LIBERALLY

CONSUME ADEQUATELY

Carbohydrates, fats and proteins are macronutrients, which are needed in large
amounts. Vitamins and minerals constitute the micronutrients and are required in
small amounts. These nutrients are necessary for physiological and biochemical
processes by which the human body acquires, assimilates and utilizes food to
maintain health and activity.
Carbohydrates
Carbohydrates are either simple or complex, and are major sources of energy in
all human diets. They provide energy of 4 Kcal/g. The simple carbohydrates,
glucose and fructose, are found in fruits, vegetables and honey, sucrose in sugar
and lactose in milk, while the complex polysaccharides are starches in cereals,
millets, pulses and root vegetables and glycogen in animal foods. The other complex
carbohydrates which are resistant to digestion in the human digestive tract are
cellulose in vegetables and whole grains, and gums and pectins in vegetables, fruits
and cereals, which constitute the dietary fibre component. In India, 70-80% of total
dietary calories are derived from carbohydrates present in plant foods such as
cereals, millets and pulses.
Dietary fibre delays and retards absorption of carbohydrates and fats and
increases the satiety value. Diets rich in fibre reduce glucose and lipids in blood and
increase the bulk of the stools. Diets rich in complex carbohydrates are healthier
than low-fibre diets based on refined and processed foods.
Proteins
Proteins are primary structural and functional components of every living cell.
Almost half the protein in our body is in the form of muscle and the rest of it is in bone,
cartilage and skin. Proteins are complex molecules composed of different amino
acids. Certain amino acids which are termed “essential”, have to be obtained from
proteins in the diet since they are not synthesized in the human body. Other nonessential amino acids can be synthesized in the body to build proteins. Proteins
perform a wide range of functions and also provide energy (4 Kcal/g).
Protein requirements vary with age, physiological status and stress. More
proteins are required by growing infants and children, pregnant women and
individuals during infections and illness or stress. Animal foods like milk, meat, fish
and eggs and plant foods such as pulses and legumes are rich sources of proteins.
Animal proteins are of high quality as they provide all the essential amino acids in
right proportions, while plant or vegetable proteins are not of the same quality
because of their low content of some of the essential amino acids. However, a
combination of cereals, millets and pulses provides most of the amino acids, which
complement each other to provide better quality proteins.
13

Fats
Oils and fats such as butter, ghee and vanaspathi constitute dietary visible fats.
Fats are a concentrated source of energy providing 9 Kcal/g, and are made up of
fatty acids in different proportions. Dietary fats are derived from two sources viz. the
invisible fat present in plant and animal foods; and the visible or added fats and oils
(cooking oil). Fats serve as a vehicle for fat-soluble vitamins like vitamins A, D, E and
K and carotenes and promote their absorption. They are also sources of essential
polyunsaturated fatty acids. It is necessary to have adequate and good quality fat in
the diet with sufficient polyunsaturated fatty acids in proper proportions for meeting
the requirements of essential fatty acids (Refer chapter 7). The type and quantity of
fat in the daily diet influence the level of cholesterol and triglycerides in the blood.
Diets should include adequate amounts of fat particularly in the case of infants and
children, to provide concentrated energy since their energy needs per kg body
weight are nearly twice those of adults. Adults need to be cautioned to restrict intake
of saturated fat (butter, ghee and hydrogenated fats) and cholesterol (red meat,
eggs, organ meat). Excess of these substances could lead to obesity, diabetes,
cardiovascular disease and cancer.
Vitamins and minerals
Vitamins are chemical compounds required by the body in small amounts. They
must be present in the diet as they cannot be synthesized in the body. Vitamins are
essential for numerous body processes and for maintenance of the structure of skin,
bone, nerves, eye, brain, blood and mucous membrane. They are either watersoluble or fat-soluble. Vitamins A, D, E and K are fat-soluble, while vitamin C, and the
B-complex vitamins such as thiamin (B1),
riboflavin (B2), niacin, pyridoxine (B6), folic
acid and cyanocobalamin (B12) are watersoluble. Pro-vitamin like beta-carotene
is converted to vitamin A in the body.
Fat-soluble vitamins can be stored in
the body while water-soluble vitamins
are not and get easily excreted in urine.
Food Groups
Vitamins B-complex and C are heat
labile vitamins and are easily destroyed
by heat, air or during drying, cooking
and food processing.
Minerals are inorganic elements
found in body fluids and tissues. The
important macro minerals are sodium,
14

potassium, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium and sulphur, while zinc, copper,
selenium, molybdenum, fluorine, cobalt, chromium and iodine are micro minerals.
They are required for maintenance and integrity of skin, hair, nails, blood and soft
tissues. They also govern nerve cell transmission, acid/base and fluid balance,
enzyme and hormone activity as well as the blood- clotting processes. Approximate
calorific value of nuts, salads and fruits are given in annexure 1.
What is a balanced diet?
A balanced diet is one which provides all the nutrients in required amounts and
proper proportions. It can easily be achieved through a blend of the four basic food
groups. The quantities of foods needed to meet the nutrient requirements vary with
age, gender, physiological status and physical activity. A balanced diet should
provide around 50-60% of total calories from carbohydrates, preferably from
complex carbohydrates, about 10-15% from proteins and 20-30% from both visible
and invisible fat.
In addition, a balanced diet should provide other non-nutrients such as dietary
fibre, antioxidants and phytochemicals which bestow positive health benefits.
Antioxidants such as vitamins C and E, beta-carotene, riboflavin and selenium
protect the human body from free radical damage. Other phytochemicals such as
polyphenols, flavones, etc., also afford protection against oxidant damage. Spices
like turmeric, ginger, garlic, cumin and cloves are rich in antioxidants. Balanced Diet
for Adults - Sedentary/Moderate/Heavy Activity is given in annexure 2 and figures 3
& 4. Also, sample menu plans for sedentary adult man and woman are given in
annexure 2a and 2b respectively.
What are food groups ?
Foods are conventionally grouped as :
1.Cereals, millets and pulses
2.Vegetables and fruits
3.Milk and milk products, egg, meat and fish 4.Oils & fats and nuts & oilseeds
However, foods may also be classified according to their functions (Table 4).
What are nutrient requirements and recommended dietary allowances (RDA)?
Requirements are the quantities of nutrients that healthy individuals must obtain
from food to meet their physiological needs. The recommended dietary allowances
(RDAs) are estimates of nutrients to be consumed daily to ensure the requirements
of all individuals in a given population. The recommended level depends upon the
bioavailability of nutrients from a given diet. The term bioavailability indicates what is
absorbed and utilized by the body. In addition, RDA includes a margin of safety, to
cover variation between individuals, dietary traditions and practices. The RDAs are
15

suggested for physiological groups such as infants, pre-schoolers, children,
adolescents, pregnant women, lactating mothers, and adult men and women, taking
into account their physical activity. In fact, RDAs are suggested averages/day.
However, in practice, fluctuations in intake may occur depending on the food
availability and demands of the body. But, the average requirements need to be
satisfied over a period of time (Annexure-3).
Our diet must provide adequate calories, proteins and micronutrients to achieve
maximum growth potential. Therefore, it is important to have appropriate diet during
different stages of one’s life (Figure 2). There may be situations where adequate
amounts of nutrients may not be available through diet alone. In such high risk
situations where specific nutrients are lacking, foods fortified with the limiting
nutrient(s) become necessary. A good example of such fortified foods is the salt
fortified with iron and iodine.

Guideline 2
Ensure provision of extra food and healthcare to
pregnant and lactating women
Rationale: Additional food and extra care are required during
pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy is physiologically and nutritionally a highly demanding period. Extra
?
food is required to meet the requirements of the fetus.
?
A woman prepares herself to meet the nutritional demands by increasing her

own body fat deposits during pregnancy.
?
A lactating mother requires extra food to secrete adequate quantity/ quality of

milk and to safe guard her own health.
Why additional diet is required during pregnancy and lactation ?
Pregnancy is a demanding physiological state. In India, it is observed that diets
of women from the low socioeconomic groups are essentially similar during prepregnant, pregnant and lactating periods. Consequently, there is widespread
maternal malnutrition leading to high prevalence of low birth weight
infants and very high maternal mortality. Additional foods are required
to improve weight gain in pregnancy (10-12 Kg) and birth weight of
infants (about 3 Kg).
What are the nutrients that require special attention ?
The daily diet of a woman should contain an additional 350
calories, 0.5 g of protein during first trimester and 6.9 g during
second trimester and 22.7 g during third trimester of
pregnancy. Some micronutrients are specially required in
extra amounts during these physiological periods. Folic acid,
taken throughout the pregnancy, reduces the risk of
congenital malformations and increases the birth weight. The
mother as well as the growing fetus needs iron to meet the high
demands of erythropoiesis (RBC formation). Calcium is
essential, both during pregnancy and lactation, for proper
formation of bones and teeth of the offspring, for secretion of
breast-milk rich in calcium and to prevent osteoporosis in the
mother. Similarly, iodine intake ensures proper mental
health of the growing fetus and infant. Vitamin A is required
21

during lactation to improve child survival. Besides these, nutrients like vitamins B12
and C need to be taken by the lactating mother.
How can the pregnant and lactating women meet these nutritional demands?
The pregnant/lactating woman should eat a wide variety of foods to make sure
that her own nutritional needs as well as those of her growing foetus are met. There
is no particular need to modify the usual dietary pattern. However, the quantity and
frequency of usage of the different foods should be increased. She can derive
maximum amount of energy (about 60%) from rice, wheat and millets. Cooking oil is
a concentrated source of both energy and polyunsaturated fatty acids. Good quality
protein is derived from milk, fish, meat, poultry and eggs. However, a proper
combination of cereals, pulses and nuts also provides adequate proteins. Mineral
and vitamin requirements are met by consuming a variety of seasonal vegetables
particularly green leafy vegetables, milk and fresh fruits. Bioavailability of iron can be
improved by using fermented and sprouted grams and foods rich in vitamin C such
as citrus fruits. Milk is the best source of biologically available calcium. Though it is
possible to meet the requirements for most of the nutrients through a balanced diet,
pregnant/lactating women are advised to take daily supplements of iron, folic acid,
vitamin B12 and calcium (Annexure 3).
What additional care is required ?
Adequate intake of a nutritious diet is reflected in optimal weight gain during
pregnancy (10 kg) by the expectant woman. She should choose foods rich in fibre
(around 25 g/1000 kcal) like whole grain cereals, pulses and vegetables, to avoid
constipation. She should take plenty of fluids including 8-12 glasses of water per
day. Salt intake should not be restricted even to prevent pregnancy-induced
hypertension and pre-eclampsia. Excess intake of beverages containing caffeine
like coffee and tea adversely affect fetal growth and hence, should be avoided.
In addition to satisfying these dietary requisites, a pregnant woman should
undergo periodic health check-up for weight gain, blood pressure, anaemia and
receive tetanus toxoid immunization. She requires enough physical exercise with
adequate rest for 2-3 hrs during the day. Pregnant and lactating women should not
indiscriminately take any drugs without medical advice, as some of them could be
harmful to the fetus/baby. Smoking and tobacco chewing and consumption of
alcohol should be avoided. Wrong food beliefs and taboos should be discouraged.
The most important food safety problem is microbial food borne illness and its
prevention during pregnancy is one of the important public health measure. Avoiding
contaminated foods is important protective measure against food borne illness.
22

POINTS TO PONDER
v
Eat more food during pregnancy.
v
Eat more whole grains, sprouted grams and fermented foods.
v
Take milk/meat/eggs in adequate amounts.
v
Eat plenty of vegetables and fruits.
v
Avoid superstitions and food taboos.
v
Do not use alcohol and tobacco. Take medicines only when prescribed.
v
Take iron, folate and calcium supplements regularly, after 14-16 weeks

of pregnancy and continue the same during lactation.

EAT FOLATE-RICH FOODS
?
Folic acid is essential for the synthesis of haemoglobin.
?
Folic acid deficiency leads to macrocytic anaemia.
?
Pregnant women need more of folic acid.
?
Folic acid supplements increase birth weight and reduce congenital

anomalies.
?
Green leafy vegetables, legumes, nuts and liver are good sources of folic

acid.
?
500 mg (0.5mg) folic acid supplementation is advised preconceptionally and

through out pregnancy for women with history of congenital anomalies (neural
tube defects, cleft palate).

23

EAT IRON-RICH FOODS
?
Iron is needed for hemoglobin synthesis, mental function and to provide

immunity against diseases.
Deficiency of iron leads to anemia.
?
?
Iron deficiency is common particularly in women of reproductive age and

children.
?
Iron deficiency during pregnancy increases maternal mortality and low birth

weight infants.
?
In children, it increases susceptibility to infection and impairs learning ability.

Plant foods like green leafy vegetables, legumes and dry fruits contain iron.
?
Iron is also obtained through meat, fish and poultry products.
?
?
Iron bio-availability is poor from plant foods but is good from animal foods.
?
Vitamin C - rich fruits like gooseberries (Amla), guava and citrus improve iron

absorption from plant foods.
?
Beverages like tea bind dietary iron and make it unavailable. Hence, they

should be avoided before during or soon after a meal.
?
Commonly consumed plant based diets provide around 18mg of iron as against

recommended intake of 35mg per day. Therefore, supplementation of iron
(100 mg elemental iron, 0.5 mg folic acid) is recommended for 100 days during
pregnancy from 16th week onwards to meet the demands of pregnancy.

24

Guideline 3
Promote exclusive breastfeeding for six months and
encourage breastfeeding till two years or more,
if possible
Rationale: Exclusive breast-feeding ensures safe nutrition to the infant
and all round development of health
Breast-milk is the most natural and perfect food for normal growth and healthy
?
development of infants.
?
Colostrum is rich in nutrients and anti-infective factors and should be fed to

infants.
?
Breast-feeding reduces risk of infections.
?
It establishes mother-infant contact and promotes mother-child bonding.

It prolongs birth interval by fertility control (delayed return of menstruation).
?
Breast-feeding helps in retraction of the uterus.
?
?
Incidence of breast cancer is lower in mothers who breast feed their children.
?
Breast feeding is associated with better cognitive development of children and

may provide some long-term health benefits.
Why breast-feed the infant?
Breast-milk contains all essential nutrients needed for the infant; it provides the
best nutrition and protects the infant from infections. Breast-milk is a natural food
and is more easily digested and absorbed by the infant as compared to formula milk
prepared from other sources. Colostrum, which is the milk secreted during the first 34 days after child birth, is rich in proteins, minerals, vitamins especially vitamin A and
antibodies. In addition, it has a laxative effect as well. Breast-feeding helps in
reducing fertility and facilitates spacing of children. Lactation provides emotional
satisfaction to the mother and the infant. Recent evidence suggests that human milk
may confer some long term benefits such as lower risk of certain autoimmune
diseases, inflammatory bowel disease, obesity and related disorders and probably
some cancers. Therefore, breast milk is the best milk for the newborn and growing
infant.
What are the advantages of breast-milk?
In addition to providing nutrients, breast-milk has several special components
such as growth factors, enzymes, hormones and anti-infective factors. The amount
25

of milk secreted increases gradually in the first few days after delivery, reaching the
peak during the second month, at which level it is maintained until about 6 months of
age. An average Indian woman secretes about 750 ml of milk per day during the first
6 months and 600 ml/day subsequently up to one year. Many essential components
are in concentrated amounts in colostrum as compared to mature milk,
compensating for the low output during early lactation.
Breast-milk provides good quality proteins, fat, vitamins, calcium, iron and other
minerals up to 4-6 months. In fact, quality of some of the nutrients can be improved
by supplementing the diet of the mother with nutrients. Growth performance of
majority of the breast-fed infants is satisfactory up to 6 months of age. Breast
feeding is associated with better cognitive development possibly due to the high
content of docosahexaeonic acid (DHA) which plays an important role in brain
development.
When to start breast feeding and how long to continue?
Mother-infant contact should be established as early
as possible (immediately after birth) by permitting the
infant to suck at the breast. Mothers can breast-feed
from as early as 30 minutes after delivery.
Colostrum should be made available to the infant
immediately after birth. Feeding honey, glucose,
water or dilute milk formula before lactation should be
avoided and the infant should be allowed to suck, which
helps in establishing lactation. Colostrum should not be
discarded, as is sometimes practiced.
Breast-feeding in India is common among the rural and urban poor, being less so
among the urban middle and upper classes. The poorer groups continue breastfeeding for longer duration than the educated upper and middle income groups. The
economically advantaged or the working mother tends to discontinue breast-feeding
early. A baby should be exclusively breast-fed only up to 6 months and complementary foods should be introduced thereafter. Breast-feeding can be continued as
long as possible, even up to 2 years. Demand feeding helps in maintaining lactation
for a longer time. If babies are quiet or sleep for 2 hours after a feed and show
adequate weight gain, feeding may be assumed as adequate. Breast-fed infants do
not need additional water. Feeding water reduces the breast milk intake and
increases the risk of diarrhoea and should, therefore, be avoided. Giving additional
water is unnecessary even in hot climate.
26

What are the effects of maternal malnutrition on breast-milk?
Composition of breast-milk depends to some extent on maternal nutrition. In
general, even the undernourished mothers can successfully breast-feed. But in the
case of severe malnutrition, both the quality and quantity of breast-milk may be
affected. Protein content of breast-milk appears to be much less affected as
compared to fat in malnutrition. Concentration of water-soluble vitamins as well as
fat soluble vitamin A (beta-carotene) is influenced by the quality of the maternal diet.
Supplementation of vitamins A and B-complex to lactating mothers increases the
levels of these vitamins in breast-milk. Zinc and iron from breast-milk are better
absorbed than from other food sources. Trace element composition of breast-milk,
however, is not affected by the mother's nutritional status.
How does breast-milk protect against infection ?
Diseases and death among breast-fed infants are much lower than those among
formula-fed infants. Breast-feeding protects against diarrhoea and upper respiratory
tract infections. The bifidus factor in breast-milk promotes the natural gut flora. The
gut flora and the low pH of breast-milk inhibit the growth of pathogens. Breast-milk
has immunoglobulins (IgA), lactoferrin, lactoperoxidase and complements which
protect the infant from several infections. Antibodies to E-coli and some viruses are
found in breast milk, which protect the gut mucosa. Breast-feeding also protects
infants from vulnerability to allergic reactions.
What ensures an adequate supply of breast-milk?
It is necessary that the woman is emotionally prepared during pregnancy for
breast-feeding and is encouraged to eat a well-balanced diet. Anxiety and emotional
upset must be avoided and adequate rest should be ensured. It is necessary to
prepare the breast, particularly the nipple, for breast-feeding. Mother should initiate
breast-feeding as early as possible after delivery and feed the child on demand. Milk
production of the mother is determined by the infant’s demand. Frequent sucking by
the baby and complete emptying of breast are important for sustaining adequate
breast milk output. A working mother can express her breast milk and store it
hygienically up to 8 hrs. This can be fed to her infant by the caretaker.
Are drugs secreted in breast-milk ?
Since, drugs (antibiotics, caffeine, hormones and alcohol) are secreted into the
breast-milk and could prove harmful to the breast-fed infant, caution should be
exercised by the lactating mother while taking medicines.

27

Should HIV positive women breast feed their babies?
HIV may be transmitted from mother to infant through breast milk. However,
women living in the resource poor settings in developing countries may not have
access to safe, hygienic and affordable replacement feeding options. Considering
the important role of breast milk in child growth and development, following
recommendations have been proposed by National AIDS Control Organization
(NACO). When replacement feeding is not acceptable, feasible, affordable,
sustainable and safe (AFASS), exclusive breast-feeding is recommended during the
first months of life. Every effort should be made to promote exclusive breast-feeding
for up to four months in the case of HIV positive mothers followed by weaning, and
complete stoppage of breast feeding at six months in order to restrict transmission
through breast feeding. However, such mothers will be informed about the risk of
transmission of HIV through breast milk and its consequences. In addition, based on
the principle of informed choice, HIV infected women should be counseled about the
risk of HIV transmission through breast milk and the risks and benefits of each
feeding method, with specific guidance in selecting the option most likely to be
suitable for their situation. In any case, mixed feeding i.e. breast-feeding along with
other feeds should be strictly discouraged as it increases the risk of HIV
transmission.

POINTS TO PONDER
?
Start breast-feeding within an hour after delivery and do not discard

colostrum.
?
Breast-feed exclusively (not even water) for a minimum of six months

if the growth of the infant is adequate.
?
Continue breast-feeding in addition to nutrient-rich complementary

foods (weaning foods), preferably up to 2 years.
?
Breast-feed the infant frequently and on demand to establish and

maintain good milk supply.
?
Take a nutritionally adequate diet both during pregnancy and lactation.
?
Avoid

tobacco (smoking and chewing), alcohol and drugs during
lactation.

?
Ensure active family support for breast-feeding.

28

Guideline 4
Feed home based semi-solid foods to the infant after
six months
Rationale: Easy to cook home made preparations are hygenic and
healthy foods for the growing baby
E
Breast-milk alone is not adequate for the infant beyond 6 months of age.
E
Introduction of food supplements (semi-solid complementary foods) along
with breast-feeding is necessary for infants after 6 months of age.
E
Provision of adequate and appropriate supplements to young children
prevents malnutrition.
E
Hygienic practices should be observed while preparing and feeding the
complementary food to the child; otherwise, it will lead to diarrhoea.
It is well accepted that breast milk is the best food for an infant. Fortunately, in
India, most rural mothers are able to breast-feed their children for prolonged periods.
In fact, this is a boon to Indian children as otherwise the prevalence of under-nutrition
among them would have been much higher. However, often, children are solely
breast-fed even beyond the age of one year in the belief that breast-milk alone is
adequate for the child until he/she is able to pick up food and eat. This practice
results in under-nutrition among young children. Working mothers, on the other
hand are unable to breast-feed their children for longer periods, as they go to work
outside.
What are supplementary/complementary foods?
Foods that are regularly fed to the infant, in addition to breast-milk, providing
sufficient nutrients are known as supplementary or complementary foods. These
could be liquids like milk or semi-solids like 'kheer' in the case of infants or solid
preparations like rice etc., in the case of children over the age of one year.
Why use complementary foods and when?
At birth, mother's milk alone is adequate for the infant. Requirements of all the
nutrients progressively increase with the infant's growth. Simultaneously, the breastmilk secretion in the mother comes down with time. Thus, infants are deprived of
adequate nutrients due to the dual factors of increased nutrient requirements and
decreased availability of breast-milk. Usually, these changes occur at about 6
months of age. Hence, promotion of optimal growth in infants, calls for introduction of
adequate food supplements in addition to continued breast feeding, from the age of
6 months onwards.
29

Can home-made recipes be nutritious supplements?
Low-cost food supplements can be prepared at home from commonly used
ingredients such as cereals (wheat, rice, ragi, jowar, bajra, etc.); pulses (grams/
dhals), nuts and oilseeds (groundnut, sesame, etc.), oils (groundnut oil, sesame oil
etc.) and sugar and jaggery. Such supplements are easily digested by all infants,
including those with severe malnutrition. The impression that only the commercially
available supplementary foods are nutritious is not correct. Some examples of low
cost complementary foods are given on page 33.
What are the principles in preparing complementary food supplements?
Weaning foods based on cereal-pulse-nut and sugar/ jaggery combinations will
provide good quality protein, adequate calories and other protective nutrients.
Since infants cannot consume bulky complementary food, in sufficient quantities,
energy-rich foods like fats and sugars should be included in such preparations.
Infants can also be fed green leafy vegetables (GLVs), which are rich, yet
inexpensive, sources of vitamins and minerals. However, greens should be well
cleaned before cooking lest the infants develop loose motions. Dietary fibre in green
leafy vegetables can, by itself, promote the bowel movements leading to loose
motions in infants. Since GLVs are rich in dietary fibre, it is advisable to initially feed
only the juice of the GLVs after cooking them properly. Infants should be introduced
to different vegetables and fruits gradually. It should, however, be remembered that
these dietary articles should be thoroughly cooked and mashed before feeding. In
families which can afford egg yolk and meat soup can be introduced. At about one
year of age, the child should share the family diet.
Amylase-Rich Foods (ARFs)
Flours of germinated cereals, which are rich
in the enzyme alpha-amylase, constitute ARFs.
Even small amounts of this type of foods liquefy
and reduce the bulk of the cereal-based diet.
Thus, ARFs help in increasing the energy
density of weaning gruels and in reducing its
bulk as well.
Mothers can add ARF to increase the
digestibility of the low-cost weaning foods
prepared at home. Preparation of ARF is
very simple and can be done by mothers
at home.
30

PREPARATION OF AMYLASE RICH FOOD (ARF)
Take 250 g of wheat
Add 2-3 volumes of water soak it for 8 hrs
Drain excess water
Germinate wheat in dark for 24-48 hours
Sun dry for 5-8 hours
Roast gently in flat pan just to remove water
Grind and powder the grains (ARF)
Store in airtight bottles/jars
Add 5 g (one tea spoon) of ARF, after cooking, to every feed
How to feed a young infant?
Infants cannot eat large quantities of food in one sitting at a given time. So, they
should be fed small quantities at frequent intervals (3-4 times a day). Also, the food
should be of semi-solid consistency for easy swallowing. When such semi-solid
foods are offered initially, the infant tends to spit it out. This should not be mistaken as
dislike for that food. The fact is that the young infant cannot achieve full coordination
needed for the act of swallowing and hence, brings out the food by movements of its
tongue. Physiological maturity of swallowing the semi-solid food develops when the
food is regularly given every day.
What are the hygienic practices to be adopted?
It is important to ensure that hygienic practices are scrupulously followed. All the
dietary ingredients should be thoroughly cleaned. Vegetables should be washed
well to remove contaminants/ parasites/ pesticides before cutting. Vegetables
should preferably be steam-cooked to reduce cooking losses. At the time of
preparation and feeding of the recipes, mother should observe proper personal
hygiene and the utensils used for cooking should be thoroughly washed or sterilized,
31

wherever possible. A number of pre-cooked and ready-to-eat foods can be prepared
for use as complementary foods (Refer page 33). Such foods should be stored in
clean bottles or tins. As feeding is likely to be time consuming, the cup or the plate
from which the recipe is being fed to the infant should be kept covered to protect it
from flies. Most often, diarrhea is caused by unhygienic practices adopted by
mothers. The weaning foods which are properly cleaned and well-cooked are safe
even for young infants.

POINTS TO PONDER
?
Breast-milk alone is not enough for infants after 6 months of age.
?
Complementary foods should be given after 6 months of age, in addition
to breast-feeding.
?
Do not delay complementary feeding.
?
Feed low-cost home-made complementary foods.
?
Feed complementary food on demand 3-4 times a day.
?
Provide fruits and well cooked vegetables.
?
Observe hygienic practices while preparing and feeding the
complementary food.
?
Read nutrition label on baby foods carefully.

WHAT SHOULD BE DONE IF BREAST-MILK IS NOT ADEQUATE?
?
If breast-feeding fails, the infant needs to be fed animal milk or commercial
infant formula.
?
Milk should be boiled before being fed to the baby.
?
To start with, milk may be diluted with an equal volume of water.
?
Full strength milk may be started from 4 weeks of age.
?
Infants fed animal milk should receive supplements of iron and vitamin C.
?
About 120-180 ml of milk should be fed with one teaspoon of sugar per feed,
6-8 times over the day.
?
While reconstituting the infant formula, the instructions given on the label
should be strictly followed.
?
The feeds should be prepared and given using a sterile cup, spoon, bottles
and nipples taking utmost care.
?
Overfeeding should be avoided in artificially-fed infants to prevent obesity.
?
Low-cost home-made complementary foods should be preferred.

Guideline 5
Ensure adequate and appropriate diets for children
and adolescents both in health and sickness
Rationale: Well-formulated balanced diets for children and
adolescents help optimum growth and boosts their immunity
}
A nutritionally adequate and balanced diet is essential for optimal growth and
development.
}
Appropriate diet and physical activity during childhood is essential for optimum
body composition, BMI and to reduce the risk of diet-related chronic diseases
in later life and prevent vitamin deficiency.
}
Common infections and malnutrition contribute significantly to child morbidity
and mortality.
}
A child needs to eat more during and after episodes of infections to maintain
good nutritional status.
Why do children and adolescents require more food?
Childhood and adolescence are periods of continuous growth and development.
An infant grows rapidly, doubling its birth weight by 5 months and tripling it by 1 year
of age. During the second year, the child increases not only in height by 7-8 cm but
also gains 4 times of its birth weight. During the pre-adolescent period the child
grows, on an average, 6-7 cm in height and 1.5 to 3 kg in weight every year and
simultaneously development and maturation of various tissues and organs take
place (Table 5).
Adolescent period (teenage) is spread almost over
a decade. It is characterized by rapid increase in height
and weight, hormonal changes, sexual maturation and
wide swings in emotion. Adolescent growth spurt starts
at about 10-12 years in girls and two years later in boys.
The annual peak rates for height and weight are 9-10
cm and 8-10 kg. Development of critical bone mass is
essential during this period as this forms the ground for
maintaining mineral integrity of the bone in later life.
The pattern and proportion of various body components like body water, muscle
mass, bone and fat increase during the entire childhood and adolescence to reach
adult values by about 18 years. Adolescent girls are at greater physiological stress
than boys because of menstruation. Their nutritional needs are of particular
importance as they have to prepare for motherhood. All these rapid anabolic
changes require more nutrients per unit body weight.
34

Growing children and adolescents require more calcium. Though recommended
dietary allowances for calcium are about 600-800 mg/day, it is desirable to give
higher quantities of calcium for adolescents to achieve high peak bone mass. To
achieve optimal peak bone mass, it is recommended to consume calcium rich foods
like milk and milk products, fox tail millet (Ragi), til etc.
Young children below the age of 5 years should be given less bulky foods, rich in
energy and protein such as legumes, pulses, nuts, edible oil/ghee, sugar, milk and
eggs. Vegetables including green leafy vegetables and locally available seasonal
fruits should be part of their daily menu. Snacks make a useful contribution to the
nutrient requirements, particularly in older children and adolescents. Frequent
changes in the menu are often liked by children.
Older children and adolescents should consume plenty of milk to fulfill the high
calcium requirements. Cooking oils/ghee (25-50g) should be consumed. Overindulgence in fats may be avoided. Excessive salt intake should be avoided
particularly by children having a family history of hypertension. Adolescence is the
vulnerable stage for developing wrong food habits as well as bad habits like
smoking, chewing tobacco or drinking alcohol. These should be avoided. In addition
to consumption of a nutritious well balanced diet, appropriate lifestyle practices and
involvement in physical activity such as games/sports should be encouraged among
children and adolescents. Balanced diet for children and adolescents are given in
annexure 4 and adolescent growth standards are given in annexure 5.
How do infections in children lead to malnutrition?
Common childhood infections like diarrhea, measles and pneumonia occur in
association with malnutrition and contribute to about 70% of mortality. Appropriate
feeding during infection is essential, which demands a lot of patience from the
mother.
During periods of infection, children tend to eat less due to reduced appetite.
Many children vomit frequently. Nutrients are also lost in urine and faeces. The
unhealthy practice of restricting diet, including breast-feeding, by the mother during
any sickness could further aggravate the problem. Hence, extra care is needed in
feeding the child appropriately during and after illness to prevent subsequent
nutritional deficiencies.
How should a child be fed during illness?
Breast-feeds are often well accepted and tolerated even by sick children and
should be continued except in severe gastroenteritis associated with shock. For
older children, consuming an adult diet, soft cooked food may be offered at frequent
intervals. The quantity of the feeds may be increased, after the illness has subsided,
till the original weight is regained.
35

What should be done during diarrhea?
Diarrhea is a common childhood disease which leads to dehydration and
sometimes death. The child requires prompt correction of fluid and electrolyte loss
using oral rehydration solution (ORS) along with appropriate/adequate feeding.
ORS can be prepared by adding a pinch of salt (between thumb and index finger)
and a teaspoon of sugar to a glass of potable water. Home-made fluids such as rice
kanji or buttermilk with salt can also be used. During infections, children should
frequently be given small quantities of fluids by mouth, including plain water. During
diarrhea, feeding should be continued, though this goes against the popular
practice. Breast-milk promotes sodium and water transport across the gut and, thus,
prevents dehydration and weight loss, in addition to providing other nutrients.
The diet of 1-2 year old children with diarrhea should provide energy of about
1000 Kcal/day. Calorie-rich, semi-solid, soft diets may be prepared from a variety of
cereals and pulses. Sprouted grains are easily digestible and provide good nutrition.
Fat and sugar help in reducing the bulk of the diets and make them energy dense.
Milk may be mixed with cereal diet to avoid lactose malabsorption. If milk is not
tolerated, it may be replaced by an equal volume of curd/yogurt/soymilk. Mashed
vegetables may be incorporated in the diet. Feeding becomes easier after the
infection subsides. About 6-8 feeds should be given during the day so that the extra
food (120-140 Kcal/kg) may be consumed by the child without any difficulty.
How important is the problem of lactose intolerance?
Deficiency of the enzyme lactase leads to lactose intolerance. During acute or
chronic diarrhea, lactose intolerance is a mild and transient problem. This problem
can be overcome by reducing the quantity of milk taken at a time or taking milk along
with a cereal-pulse meal. There is no need to stop milk in acute diarrhoea. In chronic
diarrhea, some children may develop lactose intolerance. In such children, milk may
be stopped temporarily. A diet based on cereals and pulses or chicken and egg white
allows the gut to recover and milk can then be slowly introduced. Adequate feeding
during and after diarrhea prevents malnutrition.

POINTS TO PONDER
}
Take extra care in feeding a young child and include soft cooked
vegetables and seasonal fruits.
}
Give plenty of milk and milk products to children and adolescents.
}
Promote physical activity and appropriate lifestyle practices
}
Discourage overeating as well as indiscriminate dieting.
36

EAT CALCIUM-RICH FOODS
E
Calcium is needed for growth and bone development.
E
Children require more calcium.
E
Calcium prevents osteoporosis (thinning of bones).
E
Milk, curds and nuts are rich sources of bio-available calcium (Ragi
and GLV are also good dietary sources of calcium).
E
Regular exercise reduces calcium loss from bones.
E
Exposure to sunlight maintains vitamin D status which helps in
calcium absorption.

DURING ILLNESS
]
Never starve the child.
]
Feed energy-rich cereals-pulse diet with milk and mashed vegetables.
]
Feed small quantities at frequent intervals.
]
Continue breast-feeding as long as possible.
]
Give plenty of fluids during illness.

Guideline 6
Eat plenty of vegetables and fruits
Rationale: Green leafy vegetables, other vegetables and fresh fruits are
treasure trove of several minerals and vitamins and hence,
protect from diseases
¡
Normal diet, to be wholesome and tasty, should include fresh vegetables
and fruits, which are store houses of micronutrients
¡
Vegetables/fruits are rich sources of micronutrients.
¡
Fruits and vegetables also provide phytonutrients and fibre which are of
vital health significance
¡
They help in prevention of micronutrient malnutrition and certain chronic
diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, cataract and cancer.
¡
Fresh fruits are nutritionally superior to fruit juices.
Why should we eat vegetables/fruits?
Fresh Vegetables and fruits are rich sources of micronutrients and
macronutrients (Annexure 15). The micronutrients present are minerals (like iron
and calcium) and vitamins (like vitamin C, folic acid, B complex vitamins and
carotenoids) whereas, the macronutrients present are complex carbohydrates/
fibre. They contain abundant amounts of iron, calcium, vitamin C, folic acid,
carotenoids (precursors of vitamin A) and phytochemicals. Some vegetables and
fruits provide very low calories (Annexure 6), whereas some others such as potato,
sweet potato, tapioca and yam as well as fruits like banana are rich in starch which
provides energy in good amount. Therefore, vegetables and fruits can be used to
increase or decrease calories in our diet.
What functions do these nutrients and special factors in vegetables/fruits
perform in our body?
Iron
Iron is an essential element necessary for the formation of haemoglobin, the red
pigment present in the red cells of blood. Haemoglobin plays an important role in the
transport of oxygen to the tissues. Reduction in haemoglobin in blood leads to
anaemia, a condition characterised by paleness and easy fatigue and increased
susceptibility to infections. Iron is available in plenty in green leafy vegetables. But
the absorption of iron is limited. Vitamin C rich foods must be consumed daily to
improve iron absorption.
40

Vitamin A
This fat-soluble vitamin is necessary for clear vision in dim light, and for
maintaining the integrity of epithelial tissues. In vitamin A deficiency, the white of the
eye (conjunctiva) loses its luster and becomes dry. In severe vitamin A deficiency,
the black area of the eye (cornea) gets necrosed, leading to irreversible blindness in
young children. Vitamin A also has a role in maintaining resistance of the body to
common infections. Carotenoids are plentiful in fruits and vegetables that are green
or deep yellow/orange in colour, such as green leafy vegetables, carrots, tomatoes,
sweet potatoes, papaya, mango etc.
Vitamin C
Vitamin C is an essential nutrient required for healthy bones and teeth. It also
promotes iron absorption. Vitamin C deficiency is characterised by weakness,
bleeding gums and defective bone growth. Vitamin C is abundantly available in
fresh amla, citrus fruits, guava, banana and certain vegetables such as tomatoes.
However, it is very susceptible to destruction by atmospheric oxidation. It is for this
reason that when vegetables become dry and stale or cut and exposed to air most of
the vitamin C originally present in destroyed.
Folic acid
Folic acid is a haemopoietic vitamin essential for multiplication and maturation of
red cells in our body. Its deficiency leads to megaloblastic anaemias. Folic acid
intake during pregnancy protects the foetus from developing certain congenital
defects. It also promotes the birth weight of infants. Folic acid deficiency increases
homocysteine levels in blood, thereby increasing the risk for heart disease. Green
leafy vegetables, legumes, nuts and liver are good sources of folates.
Calories
Many of the vegetables and fruits have low calories (Annexure 6). Large intake
of low calorie vegetables and fruits can help in reducing calories in diet and help in
obesity management. On the other hand vegetables like colocasia, potato, tapioca,
yam, sweet potato and fruits like banana, avocado pear (215 Kcal) and mahua (111
Kcal) have more than 100 kcal per 100gram (Annexure 7).
Phytonutrients
Vegetables provide phytochemicals and considerable health significance to the
human body. Among these, dietary fibre, antioxidants and other bio-active
constituents require special mention. These special factors are required for delaying
41

ageing and preventing the processes which lead to diseases such as cataract,
cardio-vascular diseases, diabetes and cancer.
Dietary Fibre
Dietary fibre delays the intestinal transit of the food consumed. Dietary fibre is
important for proper bowel function, to reduce chronic constipation, diverticular
disease, haemorrhoids coronary heart diseases, diabetes and obesity. They also
reduce plasma cholesterol. The protective role of dietary fibre against colon cancer
has long been recognised.
Antioxidants
In the recent past, the role of vegetables and fruits as sources of antioxidants
has been receiving considerable attention. Antioxidants restrict the damage that
reactive oxygen free radicals can cause to the cell and cellular components. They
are of primary biological value in giving protection from certain diseases. Some of
the diseases that have their origin in deleterious free radical reactions are
atherosclerosis, cancer, inflammatory joint diseases, asthma, diabetes etc. Raw
and fresh vegetables like green leafy vegetables, carrots, fresh fruits including citrus
and tomatoes have been identified as good sources of antioxidants (free radicalscavengers). The nutrients vitamin C and carotenoids that are present in these
vegetables are also potential antioxidants. Different colored vegetable provide
different antioxidants like orange colored provide beta-carotene, red provide
lycopene, deep red provide betalines, blue and purple provide anthocynins.
How much should we consume?
The Expert Committee of the Indian Council of
Medical Research, taking into consideration the
nutrient requirements, has recommended
that every individual should consume
at least 300 g of vegetables (GLV : 50
g; Other vegetables : 200 g; Roots &
Tubers : 50 g) in a day. In addition,
fresh fruits (100 g), should be consumed
regularly. Since requirements of iron and
folic acid are higher for pregnant women
they should consume 100g of leafy
vegetables daily. High calorie vegetables
and fruits to be restricted for over weight/
obese subjects.
42

Which vegetables and fruits should be consumed?
We should consume fresh, locally available and preferably seasonal vegetables
and fruits. They have more micronutrients and are tasty. However, no single fruit or
vegetable provides all the nutrients you need. The key lies in eating a variety of them
and with different colors. Include commonly consumed leafy greens, tomatoes and
other vegetables, apart from those which are yellow, orange, red, deep red, purple
colored citrus fruits, being vitamin C-rich enrich the diets significantly. Along with
these, try selecting some new vegetables and fruits to your meals.
How to prevent cooking losses ?
Vitamins are lost during washing of cut vegetables and cooking of foodstuffs.
However, proper methods of cooking can substantially reduce these losses.
Nutrient loss is high when the vegetables are washed after cutting or when they are
cut into small pieces for cooking. Consumption of properly washed raw and fresh
vegetables is always beneficial.
How do we get these foods?
Green leafy vegetables (GLVs), other vegetables and fruits are easily available.
Most vegetables, particularly GLVs are inexpensive. In fact, these foods can be
grown in the backyard with very little effort and cost. Even in lean seasons like
summer, they can be grown using water and waste from kitchen.
How to accommodate more servings of vegetables and fruits in a day?
To get the maximum nutritional benefits from fruits and vegetables, it is
important to find ways to eat more servings of vegetables and fruits per day.

Guideline 7
Ensure moderate use of edible oils and animal foods
and very less use of ghee/ butter/ vanaspati
Rationale: Excessive use of plant and animal based fats leads to the
elevation of blood lipids thereby increasing the risk of
heart disease and other illnesses.
é
Fats/oils have high energy value and induce satiety.
é
Fats provide energy, essential fatty acids and promote absorption of fat-soluble
vitamins.
é
Fats are precursors of biologically-active compounds in the body.
é
Diets that provide excess of calories, fats and cholesterol elevate blood lipids
(cholesterol and triglycerides) and promote blood clotting.
é
Excessive fat in the diet increases the risk of obesity, heart disease, stroke and
cancer.
é
Ill effects of excess dietary fats are initiated early in life.
Why do we need fats?
Cooking oils (liquid) and solid fats together are referred to as fats. Fats
contribute to texture, flavor and taste and increase the palatability of the diet. Fats
are essential for meeting some of the nutritional needs like essential fatty acids
(linoleic n-6 and alpha-linolenic n-3) and serve as rich sources of energy. Therefore,
fats should be consumed, in moderation. However, for the growth of young children
high-calorific diets are required. This is achieved by inclusion of adequate amounts
of fat (1g fat = 9 Kcals) in their diets as they cannot consume large quantities of bulky
cereal - pulse- based diets.
Fats also promote the absorption of the four fat-soluble vitamins (A,D,E and K),
impart a feeling of fullness and satisfaction and thus, delay the onset of hunger.
Along with proteins, fats constitute major components of body fluids and cell
membranes. The two essential fatty acids (EFA) namely, linoleic (LA n-6) and alphalinolenic (ALA n-3) acids (important dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids) are
metabolized at various sites in the body to generate a group of biologically-active
compounds, which perform several important physiological functions.
What are the sources of fat?
Dietary fats can be derived from plant and animal sources. Fats that are used
as such at the table or during cooking (vegetable oils, vanaspati, butter and ghee)
45

are termed as “visible” fats. Fats that are present as an integral components of
various foods are referred to as “invisible” fat. Fats, in processed and ready to eat
foods are known as hidden fats. Cereals contain only 2-3% of invisible fat. However,
their contribution to overall fat intake is significant as they contribute to bulk of our
Indian diets. The small amounts of invisible fat present in various foods add up to a
substantial level in our daily diet (about 15 g in rural population and 30g among urban
middle-income and high-income groups). Most animal foods provide high amounts
of invisible fat.

How much visible fat do we need?
The total fat (visible + invisible) in the diet should provide between 20-30% of total
calories. The visible fat intake in the diets can go upto 50g/person/day based on the
level of physical activity and physiological status. Adults with sedentary lifestyle
should consume about 25 g of visible fat, while individuals involved in hard physical
work require 30 - 40g of visible fat. Visible fat intake should be increased during
pregnancy and lactation to 30g. The higher fat and EFA requirements during
pregnancy and lactation are to meet the requirements of fetus and young infants, in
view of their crucial role in physical and neuronal growth and development. Diets of
young children and adolescents should contain about 30-50g/day. However,
ingestion of too much fat is not conducive to good health.
What are the chemical components of fat?
Fatty acids: All fats in foods provide mixtures of three types of fatty acids, which are
the “building blocks” of fats. Fatty acids are the primary constituents of all dietary
fats. Based on their chemical nature, the fatty acids are broadly grouped as
saturated (SFA), monounsaturated (MUFA) and polyunsaturated (PUFA). There are
several fatty acids in each group. Fats from coconut oil, vanaspati, animal fats (ghee
and butter) and animal foods like milk, milk products and meat provide saturated
fatty acids. The short and medium chain saturated fatty acids present in ghee, butter
46

and coconut oil are easily digested and absorbed and are therefore, good for infants
and young children. However, high intake of saturated fatty acids increases
atherogenic risk and their intake should be limited in adults. Oils from sources such
as palm, groundnut, cottonseed, sesame and olive are rich in monounsaturated
fattyacids as compared to other oils. Linoleic (n-6) and a -linolenic (n-3) acids are the
simple PUFA, which are present only in plant foods (Table 6). All vegetable oils
(except coconut) are good sources of linoleic(n-6) acid. Soyabean, rapeseed and
mustard oils are the only vegetable oils, which contribute significant proportion of alinolenic (n-3) acid. Legumes/pulses mustard and fenugreek seeds and green leafy
vegetables are also good sources of a-linolenic (n-3) acid (Table 7). On the other
hand, fish and fish oils provide long chain n-3 fatty acids, which are biologically more
active than alpha-linolenic (n-3) acid present in plant foods.

Dietary fats also contain minor components such as tocopherols, tocotrienols,
sterols etc. The natural flavour of fats/oils is largely due to these minor components.
Since most of the minor components are antioxidants, they prevent fats from going
rancid. Tocotrienols in palm oil, lignans in sesame oil and oryzanol and tocotrienols
in rice-bran oil reduce blood cholesterol. Refining of oils, though does not alter their
fatty acid composition, modifies the composition of minor components; for example,
carotenes are lost during refining of crude palm oil.
Cholesterol: Cholesterol is present only in foods of animal origin such as milk,
meat, shrimp and prawn, but not in plant foods. Vegetable oils do not contain
cholesterol. Egg yolk, and organ meats such as liver, kidney and brain contain very
high amounts of cholesterol. Cholesterol is found in all body cells and plays a key
role in the formation of brain, nerve tissue and is a pre-cursor for some hormones
and vitamin D. It is synthesized in the body and hence it is not an essential dietary
component.

Higher dietary cholesterol increases blood cholesterol. The blood cholesterolelevating effect of dietary saturated fats increases, when cholesterol consumption is
high. Therefore, cholesterol intake should be maintained below 200 mg/day. One
can reduce both saturated fat and cholesterol intake by limiting the consumption of
high-fat animal foods like butter, ghee, meat, egg and organ meats and consuming
low fat (skimmed) milk instead of whole milk. However, consumption of eggs (3eggs/
week) is recommended in view of several nutritional advantages.
What are the physiological/health implications of different fats/fatty acids?
Saturated fatty acids are known to increase serum total and LDL-cholesterol
levels, reduce insulin sensitivity and enhance thrombogenicity and increase CVD
risk. Therefore, SFA intake should not exceed 8-10% of total energy. Skimmed milk
should be preferred instead of whole milk. Restrict consumption of butter and
cheese. PUFAs are essential components of cell membranes. While n-6 PUFAs are
predominant in all cells, the nerve tissue has high levels of long chain n-3 PUFA. An
appropriate balance of the these two classes of PUFAs, namely, linoleic and alphalinolenic acids in the diets is essential for the functioning of vascular, immune,
nervous and renal systems and for early human development. PUFAs particularly n3 PUFA increase insulin sensitivity, increase peripheral glucose utilization and
decrease adiposity and hence are anti-atherogenic. n-6 PUFA decrease plasma
48

cholesterol as well as HDL cholesterol level (only at high intake). The lipid lowering
and other physiological effects of individual members of the PUFAs vary widely.
As compared to linoleic acid, alpha-linolenic (n-3) acid is more beneficial for
prevention of inflammation and accumulation of fatty material in blood vessels
(altheroscleros) and clotting of blood (thrombosis). The long chain n-3 PUFA of fish
oils and micro algae have greater antiatherogenic, antithrombotic and antiinflammatory effects than alpha-linolenic (n-3) acid of plant foods. They are
important for vision and brain growth. Therefore, pregnant women should consume
foods that are rich in ALA and long chain n-3 PUFA from fish and fish oils.
The intake of PUFA should be 8-10% of energy intake. The remaining 8-10% of
fat calories can be derived from mono-unsaturated fatty acids, which also help in
maintaining plasma cholesterol. Excessive use of highly unsaturated fats should be
avoided. Further, to get a good proportion of all the classes of fatty acids, it is
advisable to consume more than one type of vegetable oils.
Fats/ lipids (triglycerides, cholesterol and phospholipids) are transported in
blood in combination with proteins in the form of ‘lipoproteins’. The low density
lipoproteins (LDL) transport cholesterol from liver to various tissues. High blood
levels of LDL cholesterol ('bad' cholesterol) result in accumulation of lipids in the
cells (atherogenic effect). High density lipoproteins (HDL) ('good' cholesterol)
transport excess cholesterol from the tissues to the liver for degradation, and are
therefore, anti-atherogenic.
Choice of cooking oils
In view of the above, an ideal quality fat for good health is the one which
maintains a balance, so as to give a ratio of polyunsaturated/ saturated (PUFA/
SFA) of 0.8-1.0, and linoleic/ a-linolenic (n-6/ n-3) of 5-10 in the total diet. For
ensuring this appropriate balance of fatty acids in cereal-based diets, it is necessary
to increase the a-linolenic (n-3) acid intake and reduce the quantity of linoleic (n-6)
acid obtained from the cooking oil. Hence, the choice of cooking oil should be as
follows:
Groundnut or Sesame or Rice bran + Mustard
Groundnut or Sesame or Rice bran + Canola
Groundnut or Sesame or Rice bran + Soyabean
Palmolein + Soyabean
Safflower or Sunflower + Palmolein + Mustard
Use of more than one source of fat/oil has the added advantage of providing a
variety of minor components in the diet. An additional way of increasing alphalinolenic (n-3) acid intake is to ensure regular consumption of oils and foods rich in
49

alpha-linolenic (n-3) acid (Table 6 & 7). Non-vegetarians have an advantage of
eating fish, which provides preformed long chain n-3 PUFA. Ideally, part of visible fat
and/or invisible fat from animal foods may be substituted by whole nuts and legumes
with good proportion of -linolenic (n-3) acid, which are also good sources of protein,
fiber, vitamins and minerals (ALA content of foods is given in annexure 9).
The plant oils in addition contain certain useful substances such as lignans
(sesame oil), sterols, tocopherols (vitamin E) oryzanole (rice bran oil), carotenoids all of which reduce cholesterol and reduce oxidant damage due to ageing,
inflamation which occur in chronic diseases.
What about vanaspati ?
Vanaspati is prepared by hydrogenation of vegetable oils. During hydrogenation, the liquid oils become solid because the mono and polyunsaturated fatty
acids are converted into saturated fatty acids and isomers called trans fatty acids.
Vanaspati is used as a substitute for ghee in cooking and the preparation of bakery
products, sweets and snack foods. Since, saturated fats are resistant to oxidation,
foods prepared in vanaspati keep fresh for a longer period. Current evidence
indicates that saturated fatty acids and a high intake of trans fatty acids may increase
the risk of heart disease. Therefore, it is essential to limit the intake of vanaspati.
The intake of trans fatty acids should not exceed 1% of energy intake.

Guideline 8
Avoid overeating to prevent overweight and obesity
Rationale: Overweight/obesity is the causative factor for several
chronic non-communicable diseases including heart
disease, diabetes and certain types of cancers
¾
A dramatic increase in the prevalence of overweight and obesity among all the
age groups has occurred in last 2-3 decades.
¾
About 30-50% of adult Indians are either overweight or obese.
¾
Overweight and obese individuals are at an enhanced risk of co-morbidities
including type 2 diabetes, fatty liver disease, gallstones, high blood cholesterol
and triglycerides, orthopedic disorders (Osteoarthritis), hypertension and
other cardiovascular diseases, certain cancers and psycho-social problems.
¾
The imbalance between the energy intake and energy out put leads to excess
accumulation of fat in various parts of the body.
What is desirable or ideal body weight or Body Mass Index (BMI)?
There is no clear definition of a desirable or ideal body weight. Body weight for a
given height of person with good health and long lifespan is considered as Ideal
body weight. A much simpler and more acceptable measure is the ratio of weight
and height, which estimates total body mass and correlates highly with the % of
body fat. The most commonly used ratio is the BMI. It is computed by dividing the
weight in kilograms by the square of the height in meters [BMI = Weight (kg) ÷
(Height M)2]. The ideal ranges of weights for a given height are provided by WHO
(annexure 5), which is useful for categorizing persons as normal (ideal), undernourished and overweight or obese.
What is obesity?
Definition of obesity is based on the degree of excess fat. More than a general
accumulation, the distribution of fat around the abdomen is now considered to be
more harmful than fat around the hips. Accumulation of fat around abdomen
indicated by higher waist circumference is considered as risk factor. In general, BMI
ranging from 18.5 to 25 is considered to be normal. However, for Asians it is
recommended that the BMI should be between 18.5 and 23, since, they tend to have
higher percentage body fat even at lower BMI compared to Caucasians and
Europeans, which puts them at higher risk of chronic non-communicable diseases.
52

The cut-off levels for categorizing overweight and obesity in children and
adolescents are different. Since, growth spurt in boys and girls occurs in different
age groups, age and gender specific BMI centiles of reference population is used to
assess their nutritional status. Thus, children with BMI less than 5th centile are
considered as undernurished and those with =5th and <85th centiles are normal, and
with =85th and <95th centile are considered as overweight. More than 95th centile are
considered as obese.
Central obesity
The waist circumference and waist-to-hip ratios are useful for estimation of
central and truncal obesity respectively. Several studies have shown that the central
obesity was directly correlated with chronic degenerative diseases especially
metabolic syndrome. Waist-to-hip ratio of more than 0.9 among men and 0.8 in
women and waist circumference 90cm for men and 80cm for women are associated
with increased risk of several chronic diseases especially in Asian Indians.
Why should we avoid obesity?
There are several health consequences of obesity. Excessive body weight
increases the risk of heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, gallstones, certain types
of cancers and osteoarthritis. Obesity invariably predisposes to reduced levels of
high density lipoproteins ('good' cholesterol) and to increased levels of low density
lipoproteins ('bad' cholesterol), and triglycerides, besides an abnormal increase in
glucose and insulin levels in blood. Considering the increasing trend in the
prevalence of coronary artery disease, hypertension and diabetes in India, it is
important to maintain desirable body weight for height and avoid obesity.
What causes obesity ?
Over-feeding during infancy, childhood and adolescence predisposes to
overweight/ obesity during adulthood. The tendency of familial obesity seems to be
inherited. Eating junk or unhealthy foods
coupled with low physical activity is
considered as a main contributor.
Complex behavioral and psychological
factors influence the eating patterns. In
addition, metabolic errors in energy
utilization may favor fat accumulation.
Insulin is an important modifier of energy
and fat metabolism favoring fat
deposition. Low and high birth weight
53

(<2500 g and >3500g), obesity during childhood and adolescence are likely to lead
to obesity in adults. It is therefore, necessary to maintain a desirable body weight by
consuming just enough calories or adjust physical activity to maintain energy
balance (intake = output). Body weight must, therefore, be checked and monitored
periodically.
Several studies have suggested that hours spent in watching television is
strongly associated with weight gain in childhood and adolescents, mostly due to the
sedentary behavior, tendency to consume snack foods while watching television
and influence of the advertisements of energy dense foods.
Adults usually tend to gain weight between the ages of 25-50 years. In women,
obesity develops just around pregnancy and after menopause.
How to reduce body weight?
There is no single regimen for weight reduction; it has to be individualized.
Weight reduction should be gradual. Weight reduction diets should not be less than
1000 Kcal/day and provide all nutrients. A reduction of half a kilogram body weight
per week is considered to be safe. Extreme approaches should be avoided and use
of drugs may be dangerous. In children, obesity should be controlled by increasing
physical activity rather than restricting food intake. Modifications in dietary habits
have to be incorporated into one's lifestyle along with adequate exercise to keep the
body weight within the normal limits.
As fat contains more than twice the calories (9Kcal) per gram compared to
protein (4Kcal) and carbohydrate (4Kcal), weight reducing diets should limit the fat
intake. Refined sugars (4Kcal) and alcohol (7Kcal) provide empty calories and
should be avoided. Refined carbohydrates which promote fast absorption of
glucose (Glycemic carbohydrates) also need to be restricted (Annexure 10). Plant
foods that provide complex carbohydrates and fibre may be preferred as they
reduce blood glucose, cholesterol and triglycerides. Weight- reducing diets must be
rich in proteins and low in carbohydrates and fats. Consumption of plenty of fruits
and vegetables would not only result in satiety but could also help to maintain
adequate micronutrient intake. Frequent fasting/ semi-fasting (cyclic weight
reduction) followed by adequate or excess food consumption will also aggravate the
problem of weight gain. All reducing regimens should be monitored by a doctor and a
dietitian.

How much of physical exercise is needed?
It is recommended to carry out at least 45 minutes of physical activity of
moderate-intensity for at least 5 days in a week. This amount of physical activity may
reduce the risk of some chronic diseases. To lose weight, experts recommend that at
least 60 minutes of moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity be taken on
most days of the week. In addition, one should follow a nutritious eating plan and
consume fewer calories. Therefore, it is essential to remember that the body weight
56

is affected by the balance of “calories-consumed” and “calories-burned.” Those,
who are on low calorie diets for body weight reduction should have moderate to
vigorous intensity physical activities at least for 60-90 minutes daily. Physical activity
is essential for successful long-term weight management and will depend on current
BMI and health condition (Annexure 11).
Levels of physical activity
There are two basic levels of physical activity.
Moderate: This includes walking briskly (about 5-6 KM in an hour), climbing,
gardening/yard work, dancing, walking short distances for fetching milk and
vegetables, bicycling (about 16 KM in an hour), and weight training (a general light
workout), yogasanas and pranayama, playing with children.
Vigorous: Examples are running/jogging (7 KM in an hour), cycling (> 16 KM in an
hour), swimming (freestyle laps), aerobics, brisk walking (6 KM in an hour), weight
lifting (vigorous effort), competitive sports and heavy yard work, such as digging,
cutting wood.
The approximate energy costs of various physical activities in different
intensities for a 60 kg person are given in annexure-11.
If a physical activity does not increase the heart rate, it is not intense enough to be
counted in the category of “45 minutes of exercise a day”. Activities that do not
increase the heart rate include walking at a casual pace, grocery shopping, and
doing light household chores.
Types of physical activities
These activities are very beneficial to health.
Aerobic activities
These speed your heart rate and breathing while improving heart and lung
fitness. Examples: brisk walking, jogging and swimming.
Resistance, strength building and weight-bearing activities
These help build and maintain bones and muscles by working them against
gravity. Lifting weights, walking with child in arms are a few examples.
Balance and stretching activities
Dancing, gentle stretching, yoga, martial arts and Tai chi reduce risk of injuries
by improving physical stability and flexibility.

activity every day is recommended. However, it should be undertaken in
consultation with the physician. Like others, geriatric population also will be
benefitted considerably by physical activity, which will help in the reduction of
functional impairment and improve lean body mass.

58

People with heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, asthma,
osteoporosis and obesity should consult physician before taking up the exercise
program. Men over 40 and women over 50 should also consult doctor or health care
provider before starting a vigorous physical activity program.

Guideline 10
Restrict salt intake to minimum
Rationale: Increased salt intake may pose health risk and may lead to
hypertension and heart disease
Sodium is the major electrolyte in the extra-cellular fluid.
·
·
Sodium plays an important role in nerve conduction and fluid balance in the
body.
·
Maintenance of sodium balance depends on kidney function.
·
High intake of salt (sodium chloride) is associated with high blood pressure
and stomach cancer.
·
All foods contain sodium. Sodium requirements can be met with moderate
salt intake.
·
Sodium intake needs to be balanced by potassium intake.
Salt is an essential ingredient of food and enhances its taste. From time
immemorial, it has been used as a preservative. All food substances contain sodium,
but added salt (sodium 40%, chloride 60%) is the major source of sodium in our diet.
Sodium is primarily involved in the maintenance of water balance and equilibrium. It
also plays an important role in electro-physiological functions of the cell. Humans
have powerful in-built mechanisms for maintaining blood pressure even on minimal
sodium intake.
Sodium is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and a positive balance
is achieved on intakes just above minimal requirements. Sodium requirements
depend on its losses through urine, faeces and sweat. The sweat loss varies
according to climatic conditions. High ambient temperatures and vigorous physical
exercise increase sodium loss through sweat. Even after 6 hours of hard physical
labor, which may generate 3 litres of sweat, the requirement of sodium chloride may
not be more than 6 g/day.
Sources of sodium
Natural diets, in general, provide about 300-400 mg of sodium a day. Cereals,
pulses, vegetables, milk, animal and sea foods are the major sources of sodium.
Indian data indicate that per capita consumption of salt ranges from less than 5g to
30g/day in different States with almost 40% of population consuming about 10g/day.
60

Since, the taste for salt is acquired, its consumption could be restricted right from an
early age.
Preserved foods such as pickles, sun dried foods such as papads, sauces/ ketch
up and canned foods contribute to higher intakes of salt.
What are the health problems associated with excessive salt/sodium intake?
There is a strong association between salt intake and blood pressure.
Prevalence of hypertension is low in populations consuming less than 3 g salt per
day. The usual increase in blood pressure with age is also not seen with such
intakes. The amount of salt consumed is reflected in urinary sodium. Drastic
restriction of dietary salt decreases the risk of hypertension. However, this effect is
not uniform as only 20-30% of population is salt sensitive. Potassium-rich foods
such as fresh vegetables and fruits decrease blood pressure. In fact, it is the ratio of
sodium to potassium in the diet which is important. Salt intake higher than 8 g/day is
considered as a risk factor for hypertension.
Besides increasing blood pressure, excessive salt may also affect stomach
mucosa and result in atrophic gastritis and gastric cancer.
Higher sodium intake leads to greater calcium excretion which may result in
reduction in bone density. Existing evidence reveals a deleterious impact of high salt
intake on blood vessels, blood pressure, bones and gastrointestinal tract. Salt intake
in our population generally exceeds the requirement. It should not be more than 6 g
per day. Salt is used as a vehicle for food fortification since, it is commonly used in
food preparation.

Guideline 11
Ensure the use of safe and clean foods
Rationale: Contaminated and adulterated foods are major causes for
several food-borne illnesses in the country
ª
Safe and good-quality foods are essential for maintaining good health
ª
Naturally-occurring toxins, environmental contaminants and adulterants in
foods constitute a health hazard.
ª
Consumption of unsafe foods can lead to food-borne diseases.
What makes food unsafe?
Microbes (bacteria and moulds) and their products are responsible for food
spoilage. Natural enzymes present in food also lead to its deterioration. Besides,
insects, rodents, adulterants, natural toxins and various chemical residues beyond
permissible levels, make the food unwholesome. In addition to moisture and
environmental conditions like temperature, storage time also influence the quality of
the food.
How do we select safe food?
Selection of the right food is the first step to ensure safe and good quality diet.
Food items purchased from reliable sources having a high turnover ensure their
freshness. Some foods carry certification mark assuring good quality. For example
AGMARK for honey and ghee; FPO (Fruit Products Order) for fruit and vegetable
products (jams, squashes, etc); ISI (Bureau of Indian Standards) for food colours
and essences. While purchasing packaged food always look for ‘best before’ or
‘date of expiry’.
Food grains purchased should be free from infestation and foreign matter
(rodent excreta and insect remains). They should be of uniform size and should not
be shrivelled, shrunken or mouldy. Foodstuffs should be free from artificial colors.
There is a risk of adulteration when fats/oils are purchased loose from unsealed
containers. Therefore, it is always safer to purchase reputed brand products in
sealed sachets/containers. It is necessary to buy pasteurized milk in sachets from a
reputed dairy or a reliable vendor to avoid the risk of adulteration and contamination.
Milk products such as butter, ghee and khoa should also be purchased from reliable
sources. Whole spices, uniform in color, size and shape should be preferred. Since
powdered spices are more likely to be adulterated, always buy certified products.
Fruits and vegetables that show patches, physical damage with bruises or wilted
63

and decayed with visible evidence of insects and moulds, should be avoided. Eggs
should be fresh and free from cracks. Meat or poultry must be examined for
characteristic color, odor and texture and should be purchased fresh or frozen.
Freshness of fresh-water fish is indicated by a stiff body, bright, clear and bulging
eyes, reddish gills, tight scales and absence of stale odor or discoloration. Fresh fish
will not show any pitting on finger pressure.
What are the best practices of storage ?
Agricultural commodities should be dried and adequately in a safe storage
structure, to protect them from moisture and to prevent the damage from microbs
like bacteria and mould producing toxins (eg. aflatoxins). Rodent attacks, and the
presence of insects and microbes, not only reduce the availability of nutrients but
render the foods harmful. Frequent and careful disinfestation of the storage
premises using rodenticides like aluminium phosphide is essential. Some traditional
household practices such as application of edible oils to grains, placing dried neem
leaves in storage bins etc., are known to prevent infestations.
Why do foodborne diseases occur?
Foodborne infections and toxicities are common particularly with consumption
of susceptible foods such as milk products like khoa, meat, poultry and even cooked
foods like rice. Improper processing, handling and cooking, and keeping cooked
foods in warm conditions for several hours before eating, promote bacterial growth
and toxin production.
How should perishable foods be handled ?
Perishable foods like milk, meat, vegetables and cooked foods, are prone to
spoilage due to microbes. These foods should be stored under refrigeration,
preferably at a temperature of 10oc or less, which retards multiplication of
microorganisms. However, even refrigerated foods, if stored for long, can get spoilt.
Cross contamination can be avoided by keeping cooked and raw foods separately.
In case of food which is cooked, if not consumed immediately has to be stored for
some time, it should be kept either hot (more than 60oc) or be cooled quickly (below
10oc). Most micro-organisms multiply at temperatures between 10 and 60oc.
Refrigerated cooked food should be heated before consumption. However,
repeated heating may be avoided.
What about personal hygiene ?
Food handlers should observe good personal hygiene to maintain food safety.
They should be free from obvious signs of illness, wounds and sores. Traditionally in
64

India, cooked food is touched by bare hands while preparing, serving and eating.
Use of spoons and ladles should be encouraged to avoid contamination. Hands
should be washed thoroughly with soap before starting the preparation of food and
after every interruption. Household pets like cats and dogs often harbour dangerous
pathogens. They should be kept away from places where food is cooked, stored or
served.
What are the common adulterants?
Foods may be adulterated with non-food material or inferior quality product.
Spoilt, stale or poor quality food is made attractive and fresh by adding harmful
colors or other chemicals. Frequently adulterated food items are milk and milk
products, cereals, pulses and their products, edible oils and spices. The different
classes of adulterants include non-permitted colors like metanil yellow; non-edible
oils like castor oil; cheaper agricultural produce like various starches in milk powder;
extraneous matter like husk, sand and sawdust; and metal contaminants like
aluminum or iron filings. Consumption of adulterated foods could lead to disease
outbreaks of epidemic proportions. Buying from a reliable and reputed source,
careful checking of foods before purchase and insisting on certified brands will all
minimize the risk of food adulteration.
How to minimize effects of pesticide residues?
Pesticides, used during cultivation of crops, can
remain as residues in foodstuffs, especially vegetables
and fruits. Exposure of the population to pesticide
residues may be harmful and can be minimized by
washing the foodstuffs thoroughly in running water
or by peeling. Cooking and other processes can
also reduce such residues (Annexure 12).
Insect control operations such as disinfestation
in the kitchen by spraying pesticides is another
source of contamination. Utmost care should be
taken to ensure that eatables are well covered and
protected from exposure to such harmful agents.

Guideline 12
Adopt right pre-cooking processes and appropriate
cooking methods
Rationale: Healthy and positive food concepts and cooking practices
are foundation for good health
§
Cultural factors play an important role in dietary practices.
§
Faulty food fads and beliefs adversely affect nutrition and health.
§
Cooking renders food palatable and helps in easy digestion.
§
Cooking destroys harmful germs.
§
Faulty pre-cooking and cooking process lead to loss of nutrients.
§
Cooking at high temperatures leads to destruction of nutrients and
formation of harmful substances.
What are common Indian food beliefs, fads and taboos?
Food habits are formed early in childhood, passed on from the elders in the
family and perpetuated to adulthood. Food beliefs either encourage or discourage
the consumption of particular type of foods. There can be neutral, harmless or
harmful practices. Unfortunately, most of the food fads and prejudices (taboos) are
associated with women and children, who are also the most vulnerable to
malnutrition. Exaggerated beneficial or harmful claims in respect of some foods,
without scientific basis constitute food fads. In addition, the belief of heat producing
and cold inducing foods is widely prevalent. Some examples are jaggery, sugar,
groundnuts, fried foods, mango, bajra, jowar, maize, eggs and meat. Papaya fruit is
strongly suspected to lead to abortion, though there is no scientific basis. Buttermilk,
curd, milk, green gram dhal, green leafy vegetables, ragi, barley flour and apples
are considered as cold inducing foods which are actually nutritious. Vegetarianism
is often practiced in India on religious grounds. Since vitamin B12 is present only in
foods of animal origin, vegetarians should ensure an adequate consumption of milk.
During certain illnesses like measles and diarrhea, dietary restriction is practiced.
This can aggravate malnutrition in young children.
What are the effects of the pre-cooking processes?
Foods, in their natural state, contain different nutrients in varying amounts.
Cooking improves the digestibility of most foods. Flesh foods get softened on
cooking and become easily chewable. Proper methods of cooking render foods
67

palatable by improving the appearance, taste, flavor and texture, thereby enhancing
acceptability. In addition, they help in destroying disease causing organisms and
eliminating natural inhibitors of digestion. In the course of food preparation,
depending on the recipe, foods are subjected to various processes such as
washing, grinding, cutting, fermentation, germination and cooking. In the Indian
cuisine, fermentation (idli, dosa, dhokla) and germination (sprouting) are common
practices. These methods improve digestibility and increase nutrients such as
B-complex vitamins and vitamin C.
What are the effects of washing and cutting ?
Foods should be washed well before cooking and consumption to remove
contaminants like pesticide residues, parasites and other extraneous material
(Annexure 12). However, certain precautions need to be taken while washing and
cutting to minimize the loss of nutrients. Repeated washing of food grains like rice
and pulses results in losses of certain minerals and vitamins. Vegetables and fruits
should be washed thoroughly with potable water before cutting. Cutting of
vegetables in to small pieces exposes a greater surface area of the foodstuff to the
atmosphere, resulting in loss of vitamins due to oxidation. Therefore, vegetables
should be cut in to large pieces. Cut vegetables should not be soaked in water for
long, as water-soluble minerals and vitamins get dissolved.
What are the effects of cooking ?
There are many methods of cooking like boiling, steaming, pressure cooking,
frying, roasting and baking. Boiling is the most common method of cooking, during
which heat-labile and water-soluble vitamins like vitamin B-complex and C is lost.
The practice of using excess water while cooking rice should be discouraged since it
leads to loss of vitamins; just sufficient water to be fully absorbed should be used.
Use of baking soda for hastening cooking of pulses
should not be practiced, as it results in loss of
vitamins. Frying involves cooking food
in oil/ghee/vanaspati at high
temperatures. Shallow frying
involves use of much smaller
amounts of oils than deep frying.
Repeated heating of oils
particularly PUFA-rich oils
results in formation of
peroxides and free radicals
and, hence, should be avoided
68

by using just enough oil. Similarly, oils which have been repeatedly heated should
not be mixed with fresh oil but should be used for process such as seasoning.
Microwave Cooking
Microwave cooking is convenient, fast and preserves nutrients and also useful
in reheating of food. But it can reheat or cook unevenly and leave some cold spots in
the food by which harmful bacteria can enter into our body. So it is discouraged to
use large amounts or big pieces in the microwave oven otherwise mix the food in
between for even heating or cooking. Never use partially heated food. Don't cook
frozen food in the microwave oven directly as it leaves some parts of the food
partially cooked.
Always use glass or pottery dishes and food grade microwave friendly plastic
dishes and wrap to re-heat foods. Approximate calorific value of some cooked food
preparation are given in annexure 8.

Guideline 13
Drink plenty of water and take beverages in
moderation
Rationale: Water is the most important nutrient of all and helps in the
upkeep of our health
v
Water is the major constituent of the human body.
v
Beverages are useful to relieve thirst and to meet fluid requirements of the
body.
v
Some beverages provide nutrients while others act as stimulants.
v
Milk is an excellent beverage for all age groups as it is a rich source of
nutrients.
Why do we need water?
Water accounts for 70% of our body weight. It is a constituent of blood and other
vital body fluids. Water plays a key role in elimination of body wastes and regulation
of body temperature. The body loses water through sweat, urine and faeces. This
loss must be constantly made good with clean and potable water. A normal healthy
person needs to drink about 8 glasses (2 litre) of water per day. During very hot
weather and while undertaking vigorous physical activity, this requirement increases
as a considerable amount of water is lost through sweat.
When is water considered safe and wholesome ?
Water should be safe and wholesome i.e., it should be free from disease-causing
agents like bacteria, viruses, parasites etc., and harmful chemical substances like
pesticides, industrial wastes, heavy metals, nitrates, arsenic and excess of fluoride.
Fluorosis, a disease with bone deformities and dental problems, results from
drinking water containing an excess of fluoride over long periods. Generally, a
concentration of 0.5 to 0.8 mg of fluoride per litre of drinking water is considered safe.
How is water rendered safe ?
If a water source is not safe for drinking, boiling it for 10-15 minutes is a
satisfactory method of purification of the water. It kills all disease-causing organisms
and also removes temporary hardness. However, boiling will not remove other
chemical impurities. Tablets containing 0.5g of chlorine can disinfect 20 litres of water.
There are many modern gadgets which claim to provide safe and wholesome water.
However, they vary in efficacy. Drinking water standards given in annexure-13.
70

How nutritious is milk ?
Milk is a well accepted and wholesome food and beverage for all age groups. It
contains most of the nutrients necessary for growth and development. It is,
therefore, specially useful or feeding infants, toddlers, growing children and
expectant women and nursing mothers. All the macro and micro-nutrients are
present in an easily digestible and assimilable form in milk. Milk proteins possess
high biological value which is almost equal to that of meat, eggs and other highquality animal proteins. Milk proteins are valuable supplements to most vegetarian
diets.
Milk is a rich source of bioavailable calcium which helps in the building up of
strong bones. Milk fat serves as a vehicle for important fat-soluble vitamins A, D and
E. Since, milk fat is of the saturated type those who have to be on a low fat diet can
consume skimmed/toned milk. For strict vegetarians, milk is the only source of
vitamin B12. Milk is also rich in riboflavin, but is a poor source of vitamins C and iron.
However, only pasteurized or boiled milk should be consumed to ensure protection
from disease-causing agents.
What is lactose intolerance ?
Lactose, the sugar present in milk, helps in the establishment of lactic acid
bacteria in the intestinal tract. If lactase, an enzyme required for digestion of lactose,
is not present in sufficient amounts, such individuals develop abdominal symptoms
on consumption of excess of milk. This is common in children following diarrhea and
is described as lactose intolerance. Drinking small quantities of milk at a time does
not usually cause any gastrointestinal problems and there is no need to discourage
intake of milk by children except in severe cases of diarrhea.
What are soft drinks ?
Soft drinks are generally of two categories, natural soft drinks and artificial or
synthetic soft drinks. Water is the main constituent of all beverages. Orange, lemon,
grape, mango, pineapple and apple are generally used in making fruit juice. sugar
cane juice is also extensively used in India, particularly during summer. Natural fruit
juices provide in addition to energy, some vitamins (beta-carotenes, vitamin C) and
minerals (potassium, calcium). Fruit juices being potassium rich are ideal
beverages for those suffering from hypertension. However, they cannot be equated
with fruits which also provide dietary fibre.
Compared to natural fruit juices, synthetic drinks do not contain nutrients unless
they are fortified. Generally, synthetic drinks are prepared using preservatives,
artificial colors and flavors such as cola, orange, mango and lime, and mostly they
71

are carbonated. Carbonated beverages contain phosphoric acid
and may damage the enamel of teeth, and affect appetite if taken
in excessive amounts. Water used for preparation of beverages
should be free from disease-causing agents and harmful
chemical impurities.
Beverages like buttermilk, lassi, fruit
juices and coconut water are better
alternatives to synthetic drinks.
What about tea and coffee ?
Tea and coffee are popular beverages.
They are known to relieve mental and muscular fatigue. This characteristic
stimulating effect is due to their caffeine content. A cup (150 ml) of brewed coffee
contains 80-120 mg of caffeine and instant coffee 50-65 mg, while tea contains 3065 mg of caffeine. Caffeine stimulates the central nervous system and induces
physiological dependence.
Generally, low doses (20-200 mg) of caffeine produce mild positive effects like a
feeling of well-being, alertness and being energetic. Higher doses (>200 mg) can
produce negative effects like nervousness and anxiety, especially in people who do
not usually consume caffeine-containing beverages. Therefore, moderation in tea
and coffee consumption is advised so that caffeine intake does not exceed the
tolerable limits. Tannin is also present in tea and coffee and is known to interfere with
iron absorption. Hence, tea and coffee should be avoided at least for one hour before
and after meals.
Excess consumption of coffee is known to increase blood pressure and cause
abnormalities in heart beat. In addition, an association between coffee consumption
and elevated levels of total and LDL cholesterol ('bad' cholesterol), triglycerides and
heart disease has been demonstrated. Therefore, individuals with heart disease
need to restrict coffee consumption. Also, those who experience adverse effects
from caffeine should stop drinking coffee.
Besides caffeine, tea contains theobromine and theophylline. These are known
to relax coronary arteries and thereby promote circulation. Tea also contains
flavonoids and other antioxidant polyphenols, which are known to reduce the risk for
coronary heart disease and stomach cancer. However, as a result of its caffeine
content, excess tea consumption is deleterious to health. Decaffeinated coffee and
tea are being marketed to obviate the adverse effects of caffeine.

72

Tender coconut water
Tender coconut water is a nutritious beverage. It has a caloric
value of 17.4 per 100 gm. The concentration of sugar steadily
increases from 1.5% to about 5.5% in the early months of maturation
and this slowly falls to about 2% at the stage of full maturity.
Tender coconut water contains most of the minerals such as
potassium (290 mg%), Sodium (42 mg%), Calcium (44
mg%), magnesium (10 mg%), Phosphorus (9.2 mg%),
iron (106 mg%),and copper (26 mg%). It is an oral
rehydration medium and keeps the body cool. However, in
patients with hyper kalemia such as renal failure, acute
adrenal insufficiency and in patients with low urine output, TCW should be avoided.
Alcohol
Alcoholic beverages contain ethyl alcohol in varying proportions. Beer contains
2-5% and wine 8-10% of alcohol, while brandy, rum and whisky contain much higher
concentrations (30-40%). Alcohol has been extensively abused as an appetite
stimulant and as a sedative-hypnotic drug. Alcohol intake, which is initiated as an
innocent social habit may gradually result in a serious addiction. It may lead to
several serious psycho-social problems and accidents.
Alcohol provides higher calories (7 Kcal/g) than
carbohydrates and proteins and thus, can contribute
to obesity. Ironically, excessive intake of alcohol is
known to suppress appetite and interfere with
absorption and metabolism of nutrients, leading to
various nutritional deficiency diseases.
Excessive intake of alcohol suppresses appetite
and as a result, leads to several nutritional deficiency
diseases. People who regularly consume more than
two alcoholic drinks (one equals about 30 ml of
ethanol) are at a higher risk for hypertension and stroke. Alcohol intake has also
been shown to increase the risk of cancer of the mouth, larynx and oesophagus,
prostate and of the breast in women. Excessive alcohol intake weakens the heart
muscle (cardiomyopathy) and also damages the liver (cirrhosis), brain and
peripheral nerves. It also increases serum triglycerides.

74

Guideline 14
Minimize the use of processed foods rich in salt,
sugar and fats
Rationale: Processed foods being rich in fats, salt, sugar and preservatives may pose a health risk if consumed regularly
?
Urbanization has increased the intake and demand for processed foods.
?
There is a trend towards replacing traditionally cooked foods with processed
foods.
?
Processed foods may not be nutritionally balanced unless fortified.
?
Sugar, a processed food, provides empty calories.
What are processed foods?
Foods that are subjected to technological
modifications either for preservation or for converting
into ready-to-use/eat foods, eliminating laborious
household procedures, are called “processed foods”.
Some of the examples are ready mixes, dehydrated
foods, pasta products, canned foods,
confectioneries, bakery, dairy products
and breakfast foods. Manufacture of
processed foods requires technology
application and machinery, and as a
result, processed foods are expensive.
Do we need processed foods?
There is an increased demand for processed, ready-to-eat and convenience
foods due to changes in lifestyle. As more and more women go to work outside, and
families have become nuclear, consumption of processed foods, particularly in
urban areas, will be on the increase. Today's consumer is looking for convenient,
easy-to-cook, and ready-to-eat foods which require less time to prepare than
traditional home-cooked foods. Food processing is must to preserve highly
perishable products like milk, meat, fish and fresh fruits and vegetables. Food
processing increases the seasonal availability of foods and enables easy
transportation and distribution over long distances.

75

Do processed foods contribute to nutrient intake?
Processed foods are generally consumed either as part of a meal, or as a snack
item. Their contribution in terms of essential nutrients depends on the type of
processing and fortification, the frequency of use, and the quantity consumed.
Processed foods are generally refined and a majority of them are rich in fat or in
salt/sugar, and are calorie dense. They lack dietary fibre and micronutrients. Thus,
caution needs to be exercised when processed foods constitute a major part of the
meal.
Breakfast cereals are increasingly being used in urban areas. Traditional
breakfast items like idli, dosa, upma and roti are rich sources of nutrients. Puffed and
parched rice products (eg. flaked rice) besides being crisp and tasty, are easily
digestible. Food items like chips, candies, peppermints, chocolates, etc., which are
popular among children, are considered as unhealthy since, they provide only
empty calories often containing artificial colors and other additives. Their use should
be discouraged.
What is the difference between instant foods, fast foods, street foods and
unhealthy (junk) foods?
Instant foods
Instant foods are those, which undergo special processing designed to dissolve or
to disperse particles more rapidly in a liquid than the untreated product. For instance,
instant noodles, soup powders, cornflakes fall under this category. Although all
instant foods need not be unhealthy in terms of high calorie or salt contents, there are
concerns about the presence of certain additives like monosodium glutamate, which
may also add up to the over-all sodium intake from the foods.
Fast Foods
Fast foods are foods already made or cooked to order within minutes for
consumption like noodles, burgers, fried fish, milk shakes, chips, salads, pizzas,
sandwiches, etc. Storage, handling and microbiological contamination are the major
concerns. Further they are calorie dense foods.
Street Foods
Street foods comprises of a wide range of ready-to-eat foods and beverages
prepared and/or sold by vendors and hawkers, especially on streets and other public
places. Idly, Wada, Dosa, Chat Items etc are examples of street foods. They may be
contaminated with pathogenic organisms unless hygienically prepared.
76

Unhealthy (Junk) Foods
Unhealthy foods are those containing little or no proteins, vitamins or minerals but
are rich in salt, sugar, fats and are high in energy (calories). Some examples are
chocolates, artificially flavored aerated drinks, potato chips, ice creams, french fries
etc.
Why should we restrict intake of unhealthy processed foods?
Frequent consumption of unhealthy processed food increases calorie intake
without providing any nutrients, vitamins and minerals. Apart from being nonnutritious, processed foods also contain food additives. Food additives consumed
beyond permissible limits may have adverse effects on health. The national food
regulatory authorities periodically review these limits. Thus, consumption of
processed foods may not only affect intake of nutrients, but in addition, increase the
risk of exposure to various chemical additives.
In the coming years, with larger constraints on time at home, demand for
processed foods is certain to increase. Therefore, it is necessary to ensure that
intake of a nutritionally balanced diet is not compromised with unwise intake of
various processed and convenience foods. Processed vegetables and fruits
available in the market are no match to nutrient rich fresh vegetables and fruits.
Why should we moderate intake of sugar ?
Sugars occur both naturally and as an ingredient in many foods. They are present
in natural foods like fruits, vegetables, milk and honey. Added sugars provide taste
and texture to foods. Sugar is present in processed foods like chocolates, jams, icecreams and soft drinks. The most familiar sugar is sucrose. Refined or table sugar
(sucrose) provides “empty calories”. Foods such as cakes, pastries, confectionery
and sweets often have high amounts of fat, and sugar, and are prepared with refined
cereals. Excess consumption of sugary foods may lead to obesity and elevated
blood lipids. Children overindulging in chocolates and candies are prone to dental
carries. For prevention of diet-related chronic diseases, sugars and refined cereals
should be sparingly used.

77

Guideline 15
Include micronutrient rich foods in the diets of elderly
people to enable them to be fit and active
Rationale: Senior citizens need more of vitamins and minerals to
remain healthy and active
÷
Body composition changes with advancing age, and these changes affect
nutritional needs of the elderly.
÷
Elderly or aged people require reduced amounts of calories, as their lean
muscle mass and physical activity decrease with ageing.
÷
Elderly are more prone to diseases due to lowered food intake, physical activity
and resistance to infection.
÷
Good /healthy food habits and regular comfortable level of physical activity are
required to minimise the ill effects of ageing and to improve the quality of life.
÷
Elderly need adequate amounts of protein, carbohydrates, fat, vitamins,
minerals and dietary fibre.
÷
Elderly need more calcium, iron, zinc, vitamin A and antioxidants to prevent
age-related degenerative diseases and for healthy ageing.
Who is an elderly person?
Individuals of 60 years and above (WHO) constitute the elderly. In India, the
elderly constitute about 7 percent of the total population (Census, 2001) and by 2016
and by they are likely to increase to 10 percent.
How are the elderly different?
Ageing affects almost all the systems of the body, and is associated
with several physiological, metabolic and psychological changes. The
changes incude decline in physical activity, digestion, metabolism, bone
mass and muscle mass. Failing eye-sight and impaired hearing may also
occur. Low appetite as a result of loss of taste and smell perception,
dental problems, atrophic changes in GIT, constipation and decreased
physical activity could lead to overall decrease of food intake and poor
absorption of nutrients. Inability to prepare food, economic dependency
and other psycho-social problems adversely affects the health and
nutritional status of the elderly.
There is a decline in immune function with advancing age, which leads to
decreased resistance to infectious diseases. The increased parathyroid
79

hormone (PTH) secretion in the elderly leads to increased bone turn over i.e.
osteoporosis. Similarly, elderly individuals are at increased risk of osteomalacia i.e.
defective bone mineralization due to lack of exposure to sunlight and poor diet.
How can the elderly lead an active life?
In general, majority of the health problems among the elderly are nutrition related.
Consumption of nutritious foods rich in micronutrients including antioxidant vitamins
& minerals and fibre, comfortable level of physical activity would enable the elderly to
live active and meaningful healthy lives, without being a burden on society and their
family members. Uncomplicated ageing can also be quite productive, say in the
domestic sphere.
What are the common diseases among the elderly?
Resistance to disease declines in the elderly. The common ailments in the elderly
are degenerative diseases such as arthritis (joint diseases), osteoporosis,
osteomalacia, cataract, diabetes, cardiovascular (stroke, heart diseases) problems,
neurological (Parkinson's, Alzheimer's) and psychiatric (dementia, depression,
delirium) disorders and cancer. Besides these, the prevalence of respiratory, gastro
intestinal tract (GIT) and urinary tract infections is common among the elderly.
What type of diet should the elderly eat?
As people grow older, they tend to become physiologically less active and
therefore need fewer calories to maintain their weights. The daily intake of oil should
not exceed 20 g. Use of ghee, butter, vanaspati and coconut oil should be avoided.
They need foods rich in protein such as pulses, toned milk, egg-white etc. The
elderly population is prone to various nutritional deficiencies. Therefore, the elderly
need nutrient-rich foods rich in calcium, micro-nutrients and fibre. Apart from cereals
and pulses, they need daily at least 200-300 ml of milk and milk products and 400 g
of vegetables and fruits to provide fibre, micro-nutrients and antioxidants. Inclusion
of these items in the diet improves the quality of the diet and bowel function. Flesh
foods and eggs add to the quality of diet (annexure 14 & 15 ).
The diet needs to be well cooked, soft and less salty and spicy. Small quantities of
food should be consumed at more frequent intervals and adequate water should be
consumed to avoid dehydration, hyponatraemia and constipation.
How can elderly remain fit and active ?
Exercise is an integral part of maintaining healthy life. It helps to regulate body
weight. The risk of degenerative diseases is considerably decreased by regular
exercise. Exercise schedule should be decided in consultation with a physician.

Exercise and Physical Activity
Adults over the age of 20 years should undertake a minimum of 30-45 minutes of
physical activity of moderate intensity (such as brisk walking 5-6 km/hr) 5-6 days of the week.
Greater health benefits can be obtained by engaging in physical activity of longer duration or
more vigorous intensity such as jogging, running, cycling and swimming.
Sedentary people embarking on a physical activity programme should undertake a
moderate intensity activity of short duration to start with and gradually increase the duration
or intensity. Other day-to-day activities like walking, housework, gardening, will be beneficial
not only in weight reduction but also for lowering of blood pressure and serum triglycerides. It
also elevates HDL (good) cholesterol in blood. Simple modification in lifestyle like
deliberately climbing up the stairs instead of using the lift and walking for short distance
instead of using a vehicle could also immensely help in increasing our physical activity.
Exercise program should include 'warm up' and 'cool down' periods each lasting for 5
minutes. During exercise, the intensity of exercise should ensure 60-70% increase in heart
rate.
Inactive men over the age of 40 years, women over the age of 50 years and people at
high risk for chronic diseases like heart disease and diabetes should first consult a physician
before engaging in a program of vigorous physical activity such as running and swimming.

Forty five minutes per day of moderate intensity physical activity provides many
health benefits. However, even greater health benefits can be gained through more
vigorous exercise or by staying active for a longer time. This also burns more
calories. Regardless of the activity being selected, one can do it all at once or divide
it into two or three parts during the day.

Removal of the Pesticide Residues from the Food Products by
Different Methods
Most of the pesticide residues can be removed by adopting four methods.
These methods should be easily adopted at the house hold level to remove the
pesticide residues. These methods are washing, blanching, peeling and cooking.
Washing
The first step in the removal of pesticide residues from the food products is
washing. About 75-80% of pesticide residues are removed by cold water washing.
Washing with 2% of salt water will remove most of the contact pesticide residues that
normally appear on the surface of the vegetables and fruits.
The pesticide residues that are on the surface of the grapes, apples, guava,
plums, mangoes, peaches, pears etc, vegetables like tomatoes, brinjal, okra require
2-3 washings. The green leafy vegetables must be washed with 2% salt water. The
pesticide residues from green leafy vegetables is removed satisfactorily by normal
processing such as washing, blanching and cooking.
Blanching
Blanching is a short treatment in hot water or steam applied to most of the
vegetables. Certain pesticide residues can effectively be removed by blanching.
But before blanching it is very important to thoroughly pre-wash the vegetables and
fruits.
Peeling
Contact pesticides that appear on the surface of the fruits and vegetables can be
removed by peeling. Steps such as concentration, dehydration, and extraction from
the raw product can further reduce pesticide residues in the end produce. The net
influence of processing almost always results in minimal residues in processed
food.

114

Cooking
Animal Products
Animal products are also the major source of contamination for pesticide
residues in human diets since the animals feed on fodder, which are sprayed with
pesticides. Pressure cooking, frying and baking will minimize the harmful effect
pesticide residues.
Dairy products
Boiling of milk at high temperatures will destroy the persistent pesticide
residues.
Vegetable Oils
Refined oils will have fewer amounts of pesticide residues. Household heating
of oils will minimize pesticide residues.

Glossary
Allergic reaction : Immunologically induced tissue response to a foreign substance
(allergen).
Alpha-linolenic acid : 18 carbon fatty acid with three double bonds; the first double bond is
on the third carbon atom from the methyl end and therefore it is called n-3 fatty acid. It is
abbreviated as 18: 3 n-3.
Amino acid : The fundamental building block of proteins.
Anabolism : Process by which complex materials in tissues and organs are built up from
simple substances.
Antioxidants : A group of substances that prevent the damage caused by the oxidation of
fatty acids and proteins by oxygen free radicals.
Atherosclerosis : Gradual deposition of fatty materials and fibrous tissues in the inner
lining of the arteries with eventual obstruction of blood flow.
Balanced Diet : A diet containing all essential (macro and micro) nutrients in optimum
quantities and in appropriate proportions that meet the requirements.
Beta-Carotene : A yellow - orange plant pigment which yields vitamin A by oxidation in the
body.
Bifidus factor : A substance in human milk which stimulates the growth of a micro-organism
(Lactobacillus bifidus) in the infants' intestine.
Body Mass Index : Body weight in relation to height. Body weight in kilograms divided by
height in metres2.
Calorie : Unit used to indicate the energy value of foods. Quantitative requirements are
expressed in terms of energy, i.e., kilocalories (Kcals). Newer unit for energy is Kjoules.
Catabolism : Process of breakdown of complex organic constituents in the body.
Cataract : An opacity of the lens of the eye resulting in impaired vision.
Cholesterol : A lipid constituent of blood and tissues derived from diet as well as from
synthesis within the body.

123

Cirrhosis : Inflammation and scarring of liver tissues resulting in impaired liver function.
Colostrum : The milk produced by mammals during the first few days after delivery.
Congenital anomalies : Deformities existing at birth or even before.
Coronary heart disease : A disease of the heart due to inadequate blood supply as a result
of narrowing/obstruction of coronary arteries which nourish heart muscle.
CU : Consumption Unit. One unit represents Recommended Dietary Allowance of energy for
a sedentary man.
Diabetes mellitus : A disease in which the blood glucose is increased and the body tissues
cannot use glucose properly.
Diverticular disease : The presence of many pouches or sac-like protrusions on the wall of
the intestine.
Empty calories : Term used for foods that provide only energy without any other nutrient, eg.
white sugar and alcohol.
Enzymes : Biological catalysts which enhance the rate of chemical reactions in the body.
Essential fatty acids (EFA) : Fatty acids like linoleic acid and alpha linolenic acid which are
not made in the human body and must be supplied through the diet.
Fatty acids : Fundamental constitutents of many lipids.
Fibre : Collective term for the structural parts of plant tissues which are resistant to the
human digestive enzymes.
Flavonoids : Pigments widely distributed in nature in flowers, fruits and vegetables.
Food Exchange : Foods are classified into different groups for exchange. Each “exchange
list” includes a number of measured foods of similar nutritive value that can be substituted
inter-changeably in meal plans.
Free radicals : Highly reactive oxygen-derived species formed in the body during normal
metabolic processes. They have the capacity to damage cellular components by oxidation.
Haemorrhoids : Commonly known as piles.

124

High-density lipoproteins (HDL) : These transport cholesterol from the extra-hepatic
tissues to the liver. They are anti-atherogenic.
Hormones : Substances produced by a gland (endocrine) which are secreted directly into
the blood stream to produce a specific effect on another organ.
Hyperlipidemia : An increase in the concentration of blood lipids (triglycerides and
cholesterol).
Invisible fats : Fat present as an integral component of plant and animal foods such as in
cereals, legumes and spices.
Ischaemia : Lack of blood supply to an organ or tissue resulting in reduced oxygen supply,
caused either by constriction or obstruction of the blood vessel.
Lactoferrin : Minor protein of milk containing iron.
Lactose intolerance : Disorder resulting from improper digestion of milk sugar called
lactose, due to lack of an enzyme, lactase, in the intestinal mucosa.
Linoleic acid : Fatty acid containing 18 carbon atoms and two double bonds. The first
double bond is on the sixth carbon atom from the methyl end. Therefore it is called n-6 fatty
acid and is abbreviated as 18:2 n-6.
Lipids : A technical term for fats. They are important dietary constituents. The group
includes triglycerides, steroids, cholesterol and other complex lipids.
Lipoproteins : Lipids are not soluble in blood; they are therefore transported as lipid and
protein complexes.
Low-density lipoproteins (LDL) : These transport cholesterol from the liver to tissues.
High blood levels indicate that more cholesterol is being transported to tissues.
Macrocytic anaemia : Anaemia characterized by red blood cells which are larger than
normal.
Macronutrients : Nutrients like carbohydrates, proteins and fats which are required in large
quantities.
Metabolism : Includes catabolism and anabolism.
Microcytic anaemia : Anaemia characterized by red blood cells which are smaller than
normal.

125

Micronutrients : Nutrients which are required in small quantities, such as vitamins and trace
elements.
Monounsaturated fatty acids : Unsaturated fatty acids with one double bond.
n-6 PUFA : Linoleic acid and its longer chain polyunsaturated fatty acids are collectively
called n-6 PUFA.
n-3 PUFA : Alpha-linolenic acid and its longer-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids are
collectively called n-3 PUFA.
Osteoporosis : A condition of abnormal porousness or thinning of bones.
Phytochemicals : General name for chemicals present in plants.
Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) : Unsaturated fatty acids with two or more double
bonds.
Processed foods : Foods that are produced by converting raw food materials into a form
suitable for eating.
Pre-eclampsia: A toxemic condition of late pregnancy characterized by increased blood
pressure, swelling of feet and excretion of protein in the urine.
Protein Energy Malnutrition (PEM) : A marked dietary deficiency of both energy and
protein resulting in undernutrition.
Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA) : The amounts of dietary energy and nutrients
considered sufficient for maintaining good health by the people of a country.
Refined foods : Foods which have been processed to improve their appearance, colour,
taste, odour or keeping quality.
Saturated fatty acids : Fatty acids containing maximum number of hydrogen atoms that
each carbon atom can carry. They do not have double bonds.
Satiety : Feeling of satisfaction after food intake.
Stroke : Popular term for cerebro-vascular disease, a sudden condition that arises from
blocking or bleeding of blood vessels in the brain, resulting in paralysis.
Thrombosis : The condition in which the blood changes from a liquid to a semi-solid state
and produces a blood clot (thrombus) which blocks blood flow.

126

Trans-fatty acids : Are mainly produced during hydrogenation of oils; a few also occur
naturally in very small quantities.
Triglycerides (Neutral fat) : The major type of dietary fat and the principal form in which
energy is stored in the body. A complex of fatty acids and glycerol.
Unsaturated fatty acids : Fatty acids in which there is a shortage of hydrogen atoms. The
carbon atoms then become linked by double bonds. Unsaturated fatty acids are less stable
than saturated fatty acids.
Visible fats : Fats and oils that can be used directly or in cooking.
Weaning foods : Foods which are used during gradual transition of the infant from breastfeeding to a normal diet.
